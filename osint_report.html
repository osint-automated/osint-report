        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments involving the United States and Latin America. Colombian President Gustavo Petro stated that the U.S. posed a "real threat" of military action against Colombia, reflecting Trump's historical threats of intervention. The U.S. continued its campaign in Venezuela, successfully seizing five oil tankers as part of efforts to exert pressure on the Maduro regime. Amidst these tensions, Venezuela released several high-profile opposition figures, reportedly at the request of the U.S. In a broader context, Trump's foreign policy prompted discussions in Europe about geopolitical alignments, as evidenced by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's assertion against a U.S. military move on Greenland and a call for NATO to maintain a strong Arctic presence. Concurrently, experts warned that the U.S. and Russia's ideologies might align over Greenland's future, potentially destabilizing NATO.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia utilized its Oreshnik hypersonic missile in a large-scale attack on Ukraine, marking the second deployment of this weapon since it was first used in November 2024. The missile targeted significant infrastructure in Ukraine's western Lviv region, situated near the border with Poland, and was reported to have caused at least four fatalities in Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities characterized the missile strike as a "grave threat" to European security, prompting calls for increased pressure on Moscow from Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Concurrently, Ukrainian military sources highlighted concerns over potential Russian strikes aimed at disrupting Starlink satellite communications, an essential tool for their operational communications since the onset of the conflict in 2022. Meanwhile, British and French defense officials reaffirmed their commitment to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, reinforcing transatlantic support during this escalated military engagement.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the world’s oceans absorbed unprecedented levels of heat in 2025, reaching a record not seen in the last eight years. In geopolitical developments, the Trump administration's focus on acquiring Greenland continued, despite uncertainty about its commercial viability for resources. Japan faced strategic challenges, particularly in light of its relationship with China and an outdated postwar framework, which Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi acknowledged while suggesting military readiness regarding Taiwan. In Latin America, Argentine President Javier Milei affirmed his intention to maintain trade relations with China, despite geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, tensions escalated between Japan and China after Takaichi's comments regarding military action over Taiwan, and Taiwan's Air Force launched a search for a missing F-16 pilot after a routine training exercise. In response to the instability within Venezuela, including a surge of crude oil held at sea due to U.S. intervention, Pakistan negotiated a $1.5 billion arms deal with Sudan to bolster its military against paramilitary threats. Finally, Iran's internal unrest led to concerns over potential disruptions in oil supply, influencing global market dynamics.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei planned to address the ongoing protests in Iran, which included instances of violent demonstrations and government attempts to suppress dissent through an internet blackout. As protests intensified, protesters across Iran chanted anti-government slogans and set buildings on fire in Tehran, demonstrating widespread discontent with the economic situation. In Aleppo, Syria, heavy fighting persisted after negotiations concerning the integration of the Syrian Democratic Forces into the national army collapsed, resulting in casualties and renewed tensions between Kurdish groups and government forces. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations in Gaza resulted in substantial Palestinian casualties, with airstrikes killing at least 14 individuals, including children, after retaliatory actions followed a failed rocket launch. On the geopolitical front, Israel's military targeted Hezbollah installations in Lebanon amidst rising fears of regional destabilization and Turkish scrutiny over Israeli activities in the Eastern Mediterranean.
