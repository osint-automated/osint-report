        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, President Donald Trump announced on 31 October 2025 that he was not considering military strikes on Venezuela, despite concerns from Caracas regarding a potential U.S. military buildup in the region aimed at regime change. Concurrently, the United States conducted a strike on 2 November 2025 in Washington, D.C., which resulted in the deaths of three individuals involved in alleged drug trafficking activities in the Caribbean, as stated by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Reports revealed that the U.S. military had begun upgrading an abandoned Cold War naval base in the Caribbean, signaling preparations for possible interventions in Venezuela. Amid escalating tensions, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson indicated that exchanges between Iran and the U.S. were ongoing, but a formal negotiation process had not yet commenced. Additionally, trends in polling suggested a decline in Republican support for military action in Venezuela, even as Trump continued to emphasize his administration's aggressive posture towards the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, Ukrainian long-range drones struck an industrial plant approximately 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) inside Russia, marking a significant escalation in their operational capabilities, as reported on 4 November. Concurrently, Ukrainian forces prepared to produce an increased volume of interceptor drones to counter Russian attacks, potentially reaching up to 800 units per day by the end of November. In response, Russian military encirclement of Ukrainian troops around Pokrovsk intensified, and air strikes targeted civilian infrastructure, resulting in multiple fatalities. Furthermore, North Korea sent around 5,000 construction troops to Russia to assist with local infrastructure rebuilding efforts, while Russia and China publicly committed to expanding their bilateral cooperation amidst external challenges.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, China urged the United States to avoid crossing its 'red lines' concerning Taiwan, democracy and human rights, the political system of China, and development rights, as stated by Ambassador to the US Xie Feng. Additionally, Bangladesh's accession to the UN Water Convention raised concerns regarding potential difficulties in its relations with India. Meanwhile, Typhoon Kalmaegi struck the central Philippines, resulting in at least 26 fatalities and widespread flooding, trapping survivors on roofs and submerging vehicles. In the realm of military developments, South Korea expanded its naval capabilities by embracing nuclear-powered submarines, a move influenced by the arms race with North Korea. Defense ministers from the Philippines, Australia, Japan, and the United States expressed alarm over China's destabilizing actions in the East and South China Seas, while a defense pact between the Philippines and Canada elicited a stern response from China, asserting that defense cooperation should not target third parties.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, military and geopolitical tensions escalated across the Middle East. The death toll in Gaza rose to nearly 70,000 since October 2023 amid continuing Israeli airstrikes, despite a fragile ceasefire. Five Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel, leading to reunions with their families while the Israeli military arrested a former top military lawyer amid an investigation into alleged abuses of Palestinian detainees. Iran positioned itself strategically by arming Iraqi militias and maintaining its uranium enrichment program amidst pressure from Western nations. Meanwhile, Hamas reported the discovery of the body of an Israeli soldier who had been held captive. In Lebanon, the army mobilized forces near the border in response to Israeli military movements. The U.S. Ambassador to Türkiye indicated that Türkiye and Israel would not engage in war, pointing to potential diplomatic efforts. Overall, the geopolitical landscape remained volatile, with various actors reinforcing their military stances and ongoing conflict exacerbating humanitarian crises.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, significant developments occurred in Sudan, where Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, a prominent warlord, solidified control over half the country amid ongoing civil conflict. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) conducted a drone strike on a funeral in El Fasher, resulting in numerous casualties among mourners. Reports indicated that hundreds of individuals were rounded up by RSF forces in the area surrounding El Fasher, highlighting the escalating violence. Additionally, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged a cessation of hostilities, warning that the humanitarian crisis was rapidly deteriorating. In international relations, the U.S. ordered the evacuation of non-emergency personnel and their families from Mali due to a heightened threat from al-Qaida-linked militants. As geopolitical tensions rise, Norway committed an extra USD 4.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan, responding to the dire situation in the region.</li>
