        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant geopolitical tensions involving the United States and Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro asserted that the U.S. could not exploit the nation's resources or transform it into a colony. Concurrently, President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, addressing the ongoing strategy for a Gaza ceasefire amid widening gaps in U.S.-Israel relations. In Latin America, Trump's administration executed a covert military operation targeting drug cartels, which intensified pressure on Maduro's regime through maritime strikes and a bogus blockade of oil shipments. The U.S. perceived the Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea as terrorist actions, contrasting their military operations against Venezuelan tankers, which were deemed legal. Additionally, the political atmosphere in the United States reflected a deep divide on Trump's policies, with indications of public sentiments shifting against his administration.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the European Union as a primary obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine. Russia intensified its military actions by launching a barrage of drones targeting Kyiv, resulting in residential damage and casualties ahead of a critical meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida. Discussions focused on security guarantees and economic agreements, while Zelenskyy expressed urgency in obtaining concessions from Trump to halt the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, the EU reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Ukraine, despite claims from Lavrov regarding Western complicity in Ukrainian corruption. In related developments, Poland announced plans to deploy a €2 billion drone defense network along its eastern border, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that military force would be used if Ukraine delayed peace negotiations.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China converted commercial cargo ships into missile platforms, arming them with advanced vertical launch cells and radar systems, effectively matching the firepower of a U.S. Navy destroyer. This transformation raised global military concerns as these vessels operated under the guise of commercial shipping. Additionally, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced that Iran had strengthened its military capabilities in response to ongoing tensions with the United States, Israel, and Europe, characterizing the situation as an "all-out war." Moreover, China expelled three high-ranking military officials—Wang Renhua, Zhang Hongbing, and Wang Peng—amidst a significant anti-corruption campaign that followed their notable absence from high-level military functions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on 29 December to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire amidst growing strategic gaps. Reports surfaced that Israeli forces invaded the Syrian village of Taranga, further intensifying ongoing military operations in the region. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate claimed that over 700 relatives of Palestinian journalists were killed in Gaza as part of a punitive campaign by Israel. Additionally, extreme weather worsened the humanitarian situation in Gaza, leaving thousands homeless. Tensions escalated in Lebanon, where an Israeli strike injured a United Nations peacekeeper, prompting renewed calls for the cessation of aggressive actions. In Somalia, the government officially demanded Israel reverse its recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland, labeling the move a violation of national sovereignty. Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian asserted that Iran faced an "all-out war" with the U.S., Europe, and Israel.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Faustin-Archange Touadera of the Central African Republic (CAR) was projected to win a controversial third term as elections took place on 24 October. Meanwhile in Libya, hundreds mourned military chief General Muhammad al-Haddad and four others, who died in a plane crash in Turkey, as they returned to Libya. In Niger, military rulers declared a “general mobilization” against armed groups, expanding emergency powers and warning of potential requisitioning of people and property. The UK government imposed visa restrictions on nationals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to non-cooperation on migrant returns. Furthermore, the Alliance of Sahel States established a 5,000-person military force to combat rising terrorist threats believed to be tied to a neo-colonial agenda. In sporting developments, Mozambique achieved a historic 3-2 victory over Gabon in Agadir, securing their first win at the Africa Cup of Nations after 39 years.</li>
