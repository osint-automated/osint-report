        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, Mexican security forces killed Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, on 23 February in a military operation supported by US intelligence, resulting in at least 62 deaths during the raid and subsequent violence. The killing triggered widespread cartel retaliation across Mexico, with gunmen torching businesses, blocking highways, and attacking National Guard troops, leaving at least 25 soldiers dead in six separate clashes. The violence forced multiple Mexican states to cancel schools, prompted the US State Department to issue shelter-in-place orders for major tourist destinations including Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum, and led US and Canadian airlines to suspend flights to affected areas. The operation marked a significant victory against drug trafficking and fentanyl production, with Mexican forces seizing rocket launchers and other weapons during the raid, though authorities fear the cartel's retaliation signals further instability ahead, with concerns extending to the 2026 World Cup scheduled to take place in Mexico.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that NATO prepared for a potential resurgence of Russian military activities in the Arctic, according to a top Norwegian military official. Russia launched extensive drone and missile attacks against Ukraine, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko asserting that "Russia will not stop." In a notable shift, UK Defense Secretary John Healey expressed a desire to be the first to send British troops to Ukraine. Ukraine's military claimed it successfully struck a weapons factory deep within Russian territory, while simultaneous air raids on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, intensified ahead of the invasion anniversary, resulting in casualties and damaged infrastructure. The geopolitical landscape became further complicated as Hungary threatened to veto a new European Union sanctions package against Russia over halted oil shipments, impacting aid to Ukraine. Reports cited significant Russian casualties, with estimates suggesting up to 1.2 million Russian and 600,000 Ukrainian casualties, underscoring the war's toll as it neared its fourth anniversary.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated heightened tensions between Iran and the United States, particularly concerning the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz, through which over $500 billion in oil and gas flowed annually, posing risks to the global economy from potential disruptions. British military assets were also deployed, as the British nuclear-powered attack submarine HMS Anson arrived in Perth, Australia, to participate in training exercises with AUKUS partners, emphasizing the ongoing military cooperation in the region. Concurrently, efforts continued to uncover the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished in 2014, reflecting the ongoing commitment to solving this aviation mystery. Additionally, recent scientific reports assessed the technological capabilities of inland ports in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, indicating a post-COVID-19 recovery effort to improve efficiency in this key logistics area.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, drew sharp condemnation from Arab and Muslim nations for suggesting that Israel holds a biblical right to much of the Middle East. This claim provoked widespread outrage, particularly from countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which described the remarks as dangerous and contrary to international law. Concurrently, significant military activities unfolded in the region, as Russian and Iranian forces conducted live-fire exercises in Iran, marking an annual event amid heightened U.S. military presence in the vicinity. Furthermore, tensions escalated following Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, which resulted in the deaths of eight Hezbollah fighters, including a senior commander. In a related geopolitical context, President Trump expressed confusion regarding Iran's lack of concessions amidst increasing American military buildup, while the Iranian government reaffirmed its refusal to capitulate to U.S. pressure concerning nuclear negotiations.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. The Somaliland Minister of the Presidency announced that Somaliland offered the United States exclusive rights to access its minerals and military bases, aiming to strengthen diplomatic ties and push for international recognition. In Nigeria, armed attacks resulted in dozens of deaths and the abduction of women and children in a village, underscoring ongoing security challenges in the region. Sudan condemned a meeting between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) chief, Mohamed Dagalo, and Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, criticizing it as a violation of human values amid efforts to end ongoing conflicts. Moreover, reports revealed that the United States deported a gay asylum seeker to a third country where homosexuality remains illegal, highlighting ongoing issues in U.S. immigration policy.</li>
