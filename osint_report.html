        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. The U.S. military conducted multiple strikes against alleged drug trafficking boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean, resulting in at least 11 confirmed fatalities since 1 September 2025. The United States intensified its pressure on Venezuela by imposing sanctions on four Venezuelan oil firms and blocking associated tankers, further escalating tensions between the two countries. Meanwhile, China criticized international responses to its military drills around Taiwan, labeling them "irresponsible" amid increasing regional friction. Additionally, Mali and Burkina Faso implemented visa bans on U.S. citizens in a notable diplomatic tit-for-tat action. These events occurred in the context of a complex global landscape marked by an unstable economy in Venezuela and significant election forecasts for 2026, including high-stakes races in Bangladesh and Brazil.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict as it neared four years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated a peace deal was 90% ready while emphasizing that Ukraine would not accept a "weak" agreement that prolongs the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a New Year address, expressed confidence in his troops, asserting victory in Ukraine. On 31 December, Russian officials reported that a Ukrainian drone strike in the Kherson Region resulted in at least 24 fatalities, with over 50 individuals injured. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 4,300 Ukrainian drones in December, setting a record. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry hinted that the strike on Kherson was a premeditated attack targeting civilians, while the Russian government accused Ukraine of committing war crimes. Elsewhere, U.S. intelligence found no evidence that Ukraine targeted Putin's residence, countering claims from the Kremlin regarding an attempted drone strike. Additionally, Lithuania protested to Russia over alleged war crimes committed by its forces in Ukraine, reinforcing ongoing tensions in the region.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that on 31 December 2025, China criticized Japan and Australia for their "irresponsible" remarks regarding recent military drills near Taiwan. These exercises, which included live-fire operations simulating a blockade, were deemed "successfully completed" by the Chinese military. Concurrently, the Chinese Coast Guard conducted law enforcement patrols around Huangyan Dao, reinforcing its claims over the territory. Additionally, the Trump administration increased sanctions against Chinese entities linked to Venezuela's oil sector. In Eastern Europe, reports suggested that Ukraine continued to require substantial support from allies to sustain its efforts against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, tensions rose in the Middle East as Saudi Arabian airstrikes targeted UAE-supplied arms in Yemen, potentially complicating the geopolitical landscape for both the US and China.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in the Middle East. On 1 January, thousands participated in pro-Gaza rallies in Istanbul, Turkiye, demanding an end to violence and urging global pressure on Israel. Israeli officials announced plans to reopen the Rafah crossing with Gaza after U.S. pressure, which they currently occupy, restricting humanitarian aid. Concurrently, Israel intensified demolitions in the West Bank amid the approval of new settler housing units, while implementing a ban on over 30 aid groups in Gaza that did not comply with new operational requirements, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. In light of rising tensions, Iranian citizens protested economic hardships connected to rapidly depreciating national currency, signaling broader regional unrest. Meanwhile, in response to Israel's military actions, the UN warned that restrictions imposed on aid organizations set a dangerous precedent, contributing to the deepening crisis in Gaza.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Mali and Burkina Faso imposed immediate travel bans on U.S. citizens, responding to a similar visa restriction enforced by the United States earlier in December. The foreign ministries of both countries confirmed the reciprocal nature of the bans, marking a significant escalation in diplomatic tensions. Additionally, Algeria’s national soccer team prepared for its upcoming match against the Democratic Republic of Congo in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2025 knockout phase, with Coach Vladimir Petkovic expressing concern over DR Congo's form. Meanwhile, Gabon's government suspended its national soccer team and dismissed the coach due to poor performance in AFCON, following three consecutive losses. In further developments, Israeli recognition of Somaliland sparked controversy, with Somalia's president alleging that Somaliland agreed to host an Israeli military base in exchange for diplomatic recognition.</li>
