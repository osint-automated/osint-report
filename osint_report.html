        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments concerning Venezuela and U.S. actions in the region. Following the intensification of tensions, U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets conducted their closest flights over the Gulf of Venezuela, raising concerns over military escalation. President Donald Trump reiterated plans for a potential land attack against Venezuela and indicated a willingness to extend military operations into Colombia and Mexico, marking a continued aggressive approach towards perceived threats in the Caribbean. The U.S. military's campaign included airstrikes on vessels suspected of drug trafficking coming from Venezuela, which elicited mixed reactions among Venezuelan communities in South Florida regarding U.S. intervention strategies. Concurrently, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who remained in hiding, was absent from the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, further highlighting the precarious state of political dissent under President Nicolás Maduro's regime.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in Eastern Europe and beyond. Estonia’s borders with Russia closed definitively, intensifying tensions as NATO and Russian forces remained on high alert in the region. Poland announced plans to transfer its remaining MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, further supporting Kyiv amid ongoing drone attacks, which saw Russia launch 80 drones against Ukraine on 10 October. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that elections could occur within three months if security is guaranteed by Western partners. In international relations, European leaders expressed concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine, as he hinted at potentially abandoning the country in ongoing peace negotiations. Additionally, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned of the EU preparing for direct military confrontation with Russia by 2030.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated heightened military tensions in East Asia as both South Korea and Japan scrambled jets in response to joint air patrols conducted by Russian and Chinese military aircraft near their territories. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed that these aircraft entered South Korea's air defense identification zone, prompting protests from both nations against the incursions. Simultaneously, China and Russia marked their 10th joint strategic air patrol over the East China Sea and the western Pacific Ocean, with defense officials emphasizing increased cooperation between the two countries. In a separate development, U.S. naval forces deployed three vessels, including aircraft carriers capable of operating F-35 stealth fighters, to the western Pacific to counter regional threats posed by China.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel intensified airstrikes in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah sites, which resulted in civilian casualties and raised concerns about potential war crimes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed the strikes were necessary due to perceived threats. In another development, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal announced that while the group would strive to reduce attacks on Israel, it resisted disarmament, asserting that surrendering weapons would undermine their cause. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers urged Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah promptly, warning that failure to do so could jeopardize ceasefire commitments and lead to renewed conflict. Severe flooding exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, impacting displaced families amidst ongoing restrictions on aid from Israel. The United Nations reported a troubling number of malnourished children in Gaza, attributing this to continued Israeli blockades despite a ceasefire agreement. In Syria, Israeli military actions reportedly injured civilians during a ground incursion, highlighting ongoing violations of Syrian sovereignty.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a series of significant military and geopolitical developments. On 9 December, a Sudanese military transport aircraft crashed at Port Sudan airbase, resulting in the deaths of all crew members amid escalating conflict in the region. Concurrently, the U.S. government sanctioned a network accused of recruiting Colombian nationals to join the fighting in Sudan. In Benin, the Nigerian Senate approved the deployment of troops in response to fears of a coup attempt, aiming to restore democratic order in the neighboring country. In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, fighting continued despite a peace deal brokered by U.S. President Trump, as rebels advanced on the city of Uvira. These incidents unfolded against a backdrop of humanitarian crises, with the United Nations urging increased funding to support global emergency needs.</li>
