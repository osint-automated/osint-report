        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States seized the M/T Skipper, an oil tanker, off the coast of Venezuela on 12 December, just before a court-ordered warrant was set to expire. The seizure significantly impacted Venezuelan oil exports, which nearly halted as U.S. forces intensified their actions against the country. The Venezuelan government condemned the U.S. seizure, labeling it as an act of "international piracy" aimed at stealing national resources. In parallel, the U.S. administration introduced fresh sanctions against Venezuela, further escalating tensions. Additionally, the Colombian ELN rebels conducted military drills, indicating preparations for conflict amid threats of potential U.S. intervention. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at possible land strikes in Venezuela targeting drug operations linked to the government, intensifying concerns over military actions in the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a series of significant military and geopolitical developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russian forces targeted Ukrainian energy and military infrastructure, employing precision strikes that included Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, resulting in power outages across Ukraine and casualties in Russia from drone attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia's aggressive tactics, which also involved attacks on Turkish-owned vessels in Ukrainian ports. As U.S. and European officials prepared for a high-stakes meeting in Berlin, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Zelenskyy to consider ceding territory to Moscow, while NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Europe must brace for potential war with Russia within five years. Concurrently, discussions emerged about granting NATO-style security guarantees to Ukraine, amid increasing tensions within the EU regarding proposals to seize frozen Russian assets. In response to local dynamics, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico stated that his government would oppose any actions prolonging the conflict.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China marked the 86th anniversary of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre with a low-key memorial ceremony in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, despite rising tensions with Japan over Taiwan. Concurrently, the Philippines reported incidents of aggression from the Chinese Coast Guard, as nearly two dozen Filipino fishing boats near Sabina Shoal faced water cannon attacks, injuring three fishermen and damaging vessels. The Philippine Coast Guard condemned these actions as unlawful. The Chinese military further called on the Philippines to cease provoking incidents in the South China Sea. Internationally, tensions escalated over the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker by U.S. forces, with Venezuela accusing the U.S. of piracy and interference.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel claimed responsibility for multiple strikes resulting in significant fatalities among Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip. On 21 October, Israel announced the killing of senior commander Raad Saad, who played a pivotal role in orchestrating attacks against Israel on 7 October, in a strike on Gaza City. Concurrently, Israeli authorities confirmed the elimination of another key weapons figure, identified as the head of weapons production within Hamas’s military wing. In Lebanon, Foreign Minister Youssef Raji warned of imminent Israeli military operations following alerts received through diplomatic channels. Additionally, a U.S. airstrike in Syria resulted in the deaths of two American soldiers and a U.S. interpreter during a coordinated attack in the vicinity of Palmyra. Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly urged Israel to lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza, as tensions surrounding the humanitarian crisis continued to escalate with Hamas halting ceasefire negotiations due to alleged Israeli violations.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Eritrea withdrew from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development on 24 October, accusing the regional bloc of anti-Ertrian actions amid rising tensions with Ethiopia. In Nigeria, Burkina Faso forced a Nigerian military aircraft to land, escalating regional tensions and leading Burkina Faso and its allies to authorize military action against future airspace violations. In another development, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered 5,000 Ethiopian refugees to leave the U.S. within 60 days as part of a larger policy to end protections for over one million refugees. In Sudan, paramilitary forces intensified their offensive in the Kordofan region, following a drone strike that killed at least three individuals. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a senior UN official alerted the Security Council about ongoing violence and a humanitarian emergency prompting calls for swift action.</li>
