        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia delivered new air defense systems to Venezuela, as noted by senior Russian lawmaker Alexei Zhuravlev, who claimed that Moscow was not restricted from sending offensive weapons, including the Oreshnik ballistic missile. The U.S. military intensified its presence in the Caribbean, conducting its 16th deadly strike against an alleged drug trafficking vessel on 24 October, which resulted in the deaths of two individuals, raising the total death toll from this campaign to at least 66. Venezuela claimed to have foiled a CIA-funded plot involving a false-flag attack as the U.S. deployed bombers near the region. Additionally, Trinidad and Tobago placed its military on alert amidst the rising tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela, while Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cautioned against any further military escalation in the situation. China's Foreign Ministry defended its "sovereign" ties with Venezuela amid growing concerns over U.S. influence in the Caribbean.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Germany commenced a significant military deployment by sending a brigade equipped with advanced Leopard 2A8 tanks to Lithuania, marking its first major permanent deployment abroad since World War II. On 1,350 days into the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Ukraine executed a deep-strike drone attack on a Russian petrochemical facility located 800 miles within Russian territory. In retaliation, Russian forces launched a massive drone and missile barrage. The Kremlin accused Ukrainian authorities of concealing the severe situation of its troops in the Kupyansk and Pokrovsk regions. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced considerations for resuming nuclear tests following remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump. Additionally, NATO conducted military exercises in Romania to demonstrate rapid response capabilities on its eastern flank, while the Netherlands transferred 18 F-16 fighter jets to Romania at a symbolic price of €1. Furthermore, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban stated his opposition to Ukraine's EU membership, claiming it would lead to war.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that HMAS Ballarat conducted replenishments at sea and helicopter cross-deck landings with HMNZS Aotearoa in the South China Sea, enhancing military engagement in the region. A report released by Chinese experts criticized the administration of Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. for its "extremist, adventurist" approach to South China Sea policy, reflecting rising geopolitical tensions. The Philippine archipelago faced severe damage from Typhoon Kalmaegi, which resulted in at least 66 deaths and caused hundreds of thousands to be displaced, particularly in Cebu province, already vulnerable from a recent earthquake. Meanwhile, China's military dismissed U.S. accusations of electronic jamming linked to two recent U.S. Navy air crashes over disputed territories in the South China Sea as "conspiracy theories." Additionally, Russia and Turkey engaged in discussions to maintain gas supply volumes amid ongoing geopolitical maneuvering, aligning with broader energy security concerns.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israeli officials, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Yoav Katz, reaffirmed their commitment to eliminating Hamas terrorists and destroying tunnels in Gaza, while rejecting proposals for exchange and asserting Israel’s autonomy in the region. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) executed a series of airstrikes and artillery bombardments in southern Gaza, violating the existing ceasefire agreement. Concurrently, the U.S. circulated a draft resolution to the United Nations for an International Security Force aimed at governing Gaza for up to two years, focusing on disarming Hamas and securing borders. Cybersecurity threats emerged as the UNK_SmudgedSerpent group targeted U.S. academics amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. In Lebanon, Israeli strikes continued despite a declared ceasefire, and Israeli troops remained active in southern Lebanon. Iran also released two French nationals after three years of imprisonment, possibly signaling a broader shift in diplomatic relations.</li>

In Morocco, the government declared a public holiday following the U.N.'s approval of its plan for Western Sahara, an area with disputed control between Morocco and a pro-independence movement. Meanwhile, the Justice Fleet, a European search and rescue operation, severed ties with Libya's Joint Rescue Coordination Centre amid ongoing humanitarian concerns. Lastly, the U.N. reported a severe food and nutrition crisis in South Sudan, warning of the dire need for urgent humanitarian aid.</li>
