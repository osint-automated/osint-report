Finally, in Africa, the humanitarian crisis in Sudan worsened, and South Africa faced internal security issues linked to the recruitment for the Ukraine conflict.</p>

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the White House tightened legal immigration reviews following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. on 30 November. The U.S. moved towards intensified military operations in Venezuela, deploying three guided-missile destroyers and a carrier group to the Caribbean, which included 12,000 troops under Operation Southern Spear. President Donald Trump issued a stern ultimatum to Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to resign, offering safe passage in exchange. Concurrently, bipartisan lawmakers initiated inquiries into reports that U.S. military actions had resulted in war crimes by targeting survivors of a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean Sea. Diplomatic tensions escalated as Maduro sought OPEC's intervention against U.S. aggression, while Trump continued to contemplate military responses amidst reports of guerrilla-style preparations by Venezuelan authorities in the event of U.S. attacks.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that diplomatic efforts to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine faced significant challenges, particularly regarding territorial and security issues. The United States intensified its immigration policies following a shooting incident involving National Guard members, while Ukraine engaged in new negotiations to end the ongoing conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, focusing on durable peace, amidst continuing Russian attacks that resulted in casualties in Dnipro. Reports highlighted a South African radio presenter’s arrest for allegedly recruiting fighters for Russia, coinciding with discussions of NATO potentially blocking Ukraine's membership without formal abandonment of its bid. Russia reportedly captured Pokrovsk, and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff prepared for meetings with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss the U.S.-led peace proposal, amid warnings that failing to incorporate Russia in the negotiations could hamper progress towards peace.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) announced plans to expand its capabilities by constructing cruise, deep-sea, and nuclear-powered vessels. Japanese media reported Tokyo's consideration of exporting a Type 03 missile system to the Philippines, a move that risks altering Japan's pacifist stance and escalating regional tensions. In the South China Sea, the Philippines deployed its coast guard flagship to challenge China’s maritime dominance, reaffirming its commitment to territorial defense. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s first domestically built submarine, part of a program initiated in 2016, missed its delivery deadline, according to Taiwan's defense minister. Additionally, a report highlighted that China’s military firms faced a 10% revenue decline due to corruption crackdowns that impacted arms deals, contrasting sharply with the overall growth of the global arms market.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel's Defense Ministry prepared new weapon systems in response to Iran's rapid military buildup, including air defense and ballistic missile capabilities, as expressed by Minister Amir Baram. Israel planned to deploy its cutting-edge Iron Beam laser system on 30 December, aimed at intercepting missiles and drones. Meanwhile, a drone attack on the Khor Mor gas field exacerbated tensions in the region, with over 100 Iranian drones launched toward Israel following the detonation of an explosive at Iran's Natanz uranium site, which resulted in casualties among top Iranian military leaders. Israeli forces demonstrated aggressive tactics in operations, including a raid on Jenin's Ibn Sina Hospital, which reportedly led to the cold-blooded execution of Palestinians under the guise of medical personnel. The Israeli government received military equipment from the United States, as an Antonov An-124 aircraft transported Oshkosh trucks loaded with armaments from the United Arab Emirates to Israel. Amid these developments, Pope Leo XIV emphasized a two-state solution during his Middle East visit, calling it the only viable resolution for ongoing Israeli-Palestinian tensions.</li>

Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Sudan escalated, with over 1,600 individuals fleeing South Kordofan in a single day amid intensified attacks by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Central African Republic's Defense Minister announced that Russian aid had significantly accelerated the country's development and infrastructure projects. In a security context, Nigeria experienced a surge in kidnappings as a pastor and bride were abducted in separate incidents. Regarding diplomatic relations, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated the nation’s commitment to remaining an active participant in the G20, despite threats from the United States.</li>
