    <p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, military and geopolitical tensions intensified across multiple regions. In Latin America, the U.S. executed air strikes targeting alleged drug-carrying boats in waters near Colombia and Venezuela, which resulted in over 60 civilian casualties in less than two months, prompting UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk to condemn the actions as "unacceptable." The Pentagon required military officials to sign non-disclosure agreements for operations in Latin America amid increasing tensions with Venezuela, where Russian authorities expressed willingness to defend against U.S. threats. A U.S. guided-missile destroyer operated in the Caribbean near Trinidad and Tobago, further exacerbating regional strains. In Eastern Europe, the U.S. announced the withdrawal of about 3,000 troops, signaling a shift in military commitments as tensions with Russia continued. In Ukraine, military intelligence confirmed the destruction of a Russian Oreshnik ballistic missile, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported a Russian troop build-up of approximately 170,000 in the Donetsk region, indicating a significant offensive. The International Atomic Energy Agency warned that Russian strikes jeopardized nuclear plant safety in Ukraine. Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi raised concerns over regional issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, while the U.S. activated a Task Force-Philippines to bolster operational cooperation in the South China Sea. In the Middle East, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun signaled readiness to negotiate with Israel to cease strikes in southern Lebanon, as Israel continued airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in Palestinian casualties amid a fragile ceasefire.</p>

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, military and geopolitical tensions intensified across multiple regions. The U.S. launched air strikes against alleged drug-carrying boats operating in waters adjacent to Colombia and Venezuela, prompting UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk to label these strikes "unacceptable" due to their drastic civilian toll, which exceeded 60 casualties in less than two months. Concurrently, the Pentagon mandated military officials to sign non-disclosure agreements regarding operations in Latin America, raising concerns over undisclosed objectives amid escalating tensions with Venezuela, particularly as Russian authorities expressed readiness to defend Venezuela against perceived U.S. threats. In the Caribbean, a U.S. guided-missile destroyer maintained a presence in Trinidad and Tobago, close to Venezuela, further heightening regional strains. Additionally, the U.S. announced a troop withdrawal of approximately 3,000 personnel from Eastern European nations, reflecting shifting military commitments as tensions with Russia persisted.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, Ukraine publicly confirmed the destruction of one of Russia's new Oreshnik ballistic missiles during a covert operation in 2024. Ukraine's military intelligence disclosed these details for the first time, emphasizing the operation's significance. Russian President Volodyr Putin announced the deployment of approximately 170,000 troops in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, aiming to capture the strategic city of Pokrovsk. This troop build-up signals a major offensive initiative by Russia in that area. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) cautioned that recent Russian strikes compromised the safety of nuclear plants in Ukraine, as Ukraine accused Russia of energy terrorism. In the context of escalating tensions, the U.S. began a troop drawdown in Eastern Europe, reducing its presence in countries including Romania and Bulgaria, which raised concerns among NATO allies about strengthening Russian aggression.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi raised "serious concerns" regarding the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang during her first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Gyeongju, South Korea, on 31 October. The U.S. established a new Task Force-Philippines to enhance operational cooperation in the South China Sea, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. In Kuala Lumpur, Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. would "stoutly defend" its interests in the Indo-Pacific during discussions with his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun. Additionally, the U.S. announced plans to withdraw approximately 3,000 troops from Eastern Europe, which raised alarms among Eastern European lawmakers regarding security in the face of rising tensions with Russia. In a separate development, Malaysia's defense minister called for ASEAN members to expand their security partnerships to include cybersecurity during talks in Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, the U.S. deployed a significant Caribbean task force near Venezuela, including the USS Iwo Jima and six destroyers, amid ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun emphasized Lebanon's readiness to negotiate with Israel to halt ongoing strikes in southern Lebanon, despite Israeli refusals. In Gaza, the Israeli military continued to conduct airstrikes, resulting in the deaths of three Palestinians amid a fragile ceasefire; this marked a fourth consecutive day of attacks. Israel returned the remains of 30 Palestinians to Gaza as part of an ongoing exchange related to U.S.-brokered ceasefire efforts. Notably, Hamas handed over two additional bodies of Israeli captives. Internationally, Turkey advanced its plans to establish an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and condemned the alleged genocide occurring there, while Germany expressed support for extending UN peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon. Additionally, Iran's nuclear activity came under scrutiny as the International Atomic Energy Agency reported suspicious activities detected at nuclear sites in Iran.</li>
