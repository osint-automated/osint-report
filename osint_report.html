        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States Coast Guard seized multiple oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, marking significant escalations in U.S. military actions in the region. On 20 December, U.S. forces intercepted a tanker in international waters, which the Venezuelan government condemned as an "act of piracy." This operation followed another seizure earlier in the month, resulting in a total of two tankers seized by U.S. forces within a span of two weeks. The U.S. government asserted that these actions were part of a pressure campaign against the Nicolás Maduro regime, aimed at combating the illicit oil trade that fuels narco-terrorism. Venezuela, led by its officials, condemned these actions, asserting claims of theft and violation of sovereignty.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that peace talks on a U.S.-proposed plan to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine proceeded constructively in Florida, as confirmed by Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Meetings took place among U.S. and Russian officials, with further discussions planned to continue following the initial day of talks. Despite these diplomatic efforts, tensions escalated with Moscow explicitly warning that any NATO troop deployment in Ukraine would provoke immediate nuclear responses. Concurrently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged the financial limitations of sustaining a large military force without significant Western aid, while Russia conducted strikes against Ukrainian defense facilities amid a climate of renewed hostilities. U.S. officials expressed concerns over the implications of European security guarantees for Ukraine, citing a need for cohesive diplomatic strategies amid ongoing military operations.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated escalating military and geopolitical developments. On 21 December, the United States intercepted an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, reinforcing a blockade against sanctioned vessels while U.S. officials focused on countering illicit oil funding linked to narco-terrorism. Venezuela condemned the interception as an act of "international piracy." In the Mediterranean Sea, Ukraine announced that it struck an oil tanker associated with the Russian shadow fleet, reflecting ongoing tensions and maritime operations in the region. Additionally, issues of piracy resurfaced off the coast of Somalia as local fishermen reported that foreign vessels were depleting fish stocks, leading to a resurgence in piracy that included the hijacking of a Malta-flagged tanker. Meanwhile, India made strategic moves to reclaim its maritime dominance through the Maritime Amrit Kaal Mission, aiming to recover from a significant reliance on foreign shipping that costs the country $75 billion annually.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in the Middle East and beyond. Israel approved 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stating the aim was to hinder the formation of a Palestinian state. Israeli forces launched ground incursions into Quneitra province, Syria, establishing temporary checkpoints and violating Syrian sovereignty. Additionally, Israeli troops conducted operations that resulted in the deaths of several Palestinians, including two killed in the West Bank and six during an attack on a school in Gaza. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard seized an oil tanker near Venezuela, marking the second seizure this month. In Turkey, discussions continued between government officials and a Hamas delegation regarding a ceasefire in Gaza. Geopolitically, obstacles arose as Hamas opposed proposals for international oversight in Gaza, viewing them as a form of legitimized occupation. Internationally, reports surfaced of anti-Semitism escalating in Germany, while Australia honored the victims of a recent gun attack targeting a Jewish celebration.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that thousands of Chinese workers returned to Africa, reversing a decade-long decline and reflecting renewed Chinese investment in strategic mega-projects across the continent. Leaders from Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso explored methods to repel fighters linked to al-Qaeda amid ongoing insecurity in the Sahel region. In South Africa, authorities reported a tragic mass shooting in Bekkersdal, west of Johannesburg, where ten individuals were killed and ten others were injured by unknown gunmen, marking the second such incident in three weeks. Meanwhile, Togo navigated a complex diplomatic landscape as it balanced relations between Russia and France, while Somali fishermen reported a resurgence in piracy linked to illegal fishing activities by foreign vessels. The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament preparations occurred in Morocco, with anticipation building around the tournament's kickoff.</li>
