        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States, under President Donald Trump, considered various military actions against Venezuela to remove President Nicolás Maduro from power, including potential airstrikes and the seizure of oil fields. On 6 November, Trump’s administration informed Congress that it lacked legal justification for immediate strikes. Meanwhile, the Senate prepared to vote on a war powers resolution aimed at preventing such actions. The U.S. military also conducted 16 drone strikes in the Eastern Pacific against alleged drug trafficking operations from September to early November, resulting in multiple casualties. The geopolitical landscape turned tense as Trump’s rhetoric around regime change pointed to a revival of U.S. interventionist policies, prompting bipartisan discussions on the implications of military escalation.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Poland and Romania initiated the deployment of a new weapons system to enhance their defenses against increasing Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace. The South African government announced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding 17 of its citizens who became trapped in the Donbas region amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Additionally, Ukrainian forces remained on high alert as the Russian Federation continued to augment its military presence in Belarus with the deployment of Oreshnik ballistic missiles, raising concerns about potential threats to Ukraine's security.

Concurrently, in Vienna, Austria, authorities discovered a weapons cache linked to Hamas, raising concerns about support for Palestinian militant activities. In Gaza, Israeli forces intensified military actions, with casualties reported in the Bureij refugee camp, amid a fragile ceasefire that has shown signs of strain.
