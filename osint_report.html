        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a significant escalation in tensions related to Venezuela. The U.S. military conducted operations near Venezuelan airspace, reportedly targeting drug trafficking routes, although experts noted that the cargo primarily consisted of cocaine destined for Europe rather than fentanyl for the United States. Meanwhile, a sanctioned Russian oil tanker altered its course after a U.S. warship intercepted its route near the Venezuelan coast. In domestic politics, the U.S. Democratic Party moved to block funding for military operations in Venezuela amid concerns over escalating military engagement. Additionally, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado faced potential charges of being a fugitive if she pursued her travel plans to accept a Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. In a related development, the Venezuelan National Assembly approved an extension of oil production projects with Russia until 2041. These events highlighted a complex and increasingly perilous geopolitical landscape surrounding Venezuela.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. A draft U.S. peace plan, consisting of 28 points, was presented to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which included demands for Kyiv to cede territory to Russia and to reduce its military size. Zelenskyy rejected any changes to Ukraine's borders and emphasized the necessity for a "real and dignified peace." While some aspects of the plan were initially considered acceptable by Ukraine, key clauses prompted strong objections, particularly regarding NATO membership aspirations and territorial concessions. Concurrently, Russia executed a substantial drone and missile assault on western Ukraine, resulting in at least 25 civilian casualties. The U.S. administration expressed urgency, pushing Ukraine to agree to the peace proposal by the Thanksgiving holiday, warning of potential consequences for intelligence support and military aid. In a parallel development, Romania scrabbled its jets to respond to drone incursions, highlighting ongoing regional tensions.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that tensions between Japan and China escalated significantly following remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi regarding Taiwan, prompting China to implement a series of economic countermeasures against Japan. This included a diplomatic rebuke as part of a broader strategy to assert its position in the region. Concurrently, a cyber espionage campaign attributed to the China-nexus threat actor APT24 utilized new malware known as BADAUDIO to maintain long-term access to compromised networks in Taiwan and over 1,000 other domains, marking nearly three years of persistent operations. In response to economic challenges, Japan's Prime Minister announced a $135 billion stimulus package, which she branded fiscally responsible despite ongoing concerns about the country's debt burden. Furthermore, the U.S. saw a reduction in its participation in NATO military exercises this year, reflecting pressure from the Trump administration for European allies to enhance their own defense contributions.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Iran's foreign ministry condemned a resolution by the U.N. atomic watchdog, labeling it “anti-Iranian” and threatening undefined retaliatory measures. In Israel, plans emerged to seize the Sebastia historical site in the West Bank, marking the largest acquisition of archaeologically significant land by Israel. Amid water shortages, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi deemed the relocation of the capital to the underdeveloped Makran region in southeastern Iran as "unavoidable," although a timeline has yet to be established. In Lebanon, authorities arrested noted drug kingpin Noah Zaitar, who faced U.S. sanctions for operating a narcotics empire. Violence escalated in the West Bank as Israeli forces killed two Palestinian teenagers during an operation near Ramallah. Concurrently, tensions remained high in Gaza as renewed Israeli airstrikes killed 28 Palestinians, prompting warnings from Hamas regarding a “dangerous escalation” of conflict. In Lebanon, the U.S. and Israel exerted mounting pressure on the Lebanese army to disarm Hezbollah, intensifying regional instability. The situation underscored the fragile status of peace efforts and ongoing regional conflicts across several states.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada announced plans for a $1 billion project to expand critical minerals processing capacity, securing $70 billion in investments from the United Arab Emirates. In Nigeria, armed groups abducted an unknown number of students and staff from a Catholic boarding school in Niger State, following a similar incident that took place just days prior in northwestern Nigeria, raising significant security concerns. In Mali, France reduced its diplomatic staff due to escalating insecurity and a fuel blockade imposed by jihadist groups. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) warned that rising terrorism constitutes an existential threat to West Africa, affecting trade and stability in the region. Additionally, an expected naval exercise involving Russia, South Africa, and China is scheduled for January 2026, indicating ongoing geopolitical collaboration among these nations.</li>
