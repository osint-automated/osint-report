        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. military heightened its activity around Venezuela, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to warn airlines and pilots to exercise caution due to a "worsening security situation." U.S. military forces conducted a bold "attack demo" off the coast of Venezuela, coinciding with discussions of designating President Nicolás Maduro and associated criminal networks as terrorists. Meanwhile, Israeli violence in the West Bank escalated, with reports of assaults against journalists covering the unrest. In Colombia, authorities announced a significant cocaine bust, seizing drugs valued over $388 million, marking the largest confiscation in a decade.

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy faced intense pressure to accept a U.S. peace plan that included territorial concessions, with U.S. President Donald Trump setting a deadline of Thursday for agreement. This plan, which sparked alarm in Kyiv and among European allies, aimed to set limits on Ukraine's military size and bar NATO membership. In South Africa, European leaders convened to discuss alternatives to the U.S. proposal, which they deemed necessary to refine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz reiterated calls for Russia to end its aggression against Ukraine, as Russian forces claimed further territory gains in Zaporizhia and Donetsk. Meanwhile, drone sightings occurred near military bases in the Netherlands, indicating ongoing threats in northern Europe.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that tensions between China and Japan escalated significantly over Taiwan, leading to a trade and diplomatic conflict that adversely affected businesses on both sides. Chinese diplomats, characterized as "wolf warriors," intensified their rhetoric against Japan's Prime Minister, particularly in nations impacted by Japan’s military actions during World War II. The United States Department of State reaffirmed its commitment to the U.S.-Japan alliance and stability in the Taiwan Strait amidst China's economic reprisals against Japan. In related developments, Taiwan's defense ministry reported the detection of 18 Chinese military aircraft and seven vessels near its territory, with multiple aircraft crossing a key median line into Taiwan's air defense zone. Furthermore, the U.S. Navy initiated efforts to recover crashed military equipment from the South China Sea, which could provide valuable intelligence to Beijing.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least 24 individuals, including children, and wounded dozens more as hostilities resumed despite a fragile ceasefire. Hamas warned U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff that it could terminate the ceasefire after Israeli forces eliminated a senior Hamas commander, further escalating tensions. In the United States, President Donald Trump announced he would terminate temporary legal protections for Somali migrants residing in Minnesota, prompting fear among the community. Concurrently, Israeli-French peace activist Ofer Bronchtein influenced President Emmanuel Macron's plan to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations. Reports also surfaced indicating that Iran's capital may be relocated due to an ecological crisis, while Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam criticized Israel for blocking withdrawal talks.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in military and geopolitical affairs. The G20 summit in South Africa concluded with leaders adopting a joint declaration emphasizing access to critical minerals, debt relief, and climate financial support, despite the absence of US President Donald Trump, who boycotted the meeting. Trump faced criticism from global leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who urged the need to revisit peace proposals concerning Ukraine. Meanwhile, Nigeria experienced a spike in violence, with over 300 students and teachers abducted from St. Mary's Catholic School in Niger state, marking one of the worst mass abductions in recent times. In Chad, escalating conflict in Sudan prompted large numbers of Sudanese families to seek refuge, exacerbating the challenges in a region already reliant on humanitarian aid. The UN condemned the recent school's abduction in Niger, calling for the protection of educational institutions.</li>
