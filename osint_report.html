        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the White House confirmed a U.S. admiral, acting under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's authority, ordered a "double-tap" military operation against an alleged drug smuggling vessel near Venezuela. This second strike, conducted on the survivors of an initial attack, drew bipartisan scrutiny and raised concerns over the legality of the action. Concurrently, tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela escalated as President Donald Trump called for a closure of Venezuelan airspace following President Nicolás Maduro's refusal to leave the country. U.S. military presence increased in the Caribbean, with a carrier strike group reportedly deployed near Venezuela, while Congress initiated bipartisan inquiries into the military strikes. Meanwhile, Maduro faced mounting pressure domestically and internationally, as thousands rallied in Caracas against potential U.S. military action, and key regional allies distanced themselves from his regime.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Kelluu, a Finnish company located 50 miles from the Russian border, was developing small airships for Arctic warfare, spurred by ongoing jamming efforts from Russia. Russian forces reportedly continued to utilize black market Starlink terminals for their drones despite international efforts to restrict access since 2024. Concurrently, President Vladimir Putin claimed that Russian troops captured the Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk and Vovchansk, which Ukraine disputed. Ukrainian troops expressed skepticism about the prospects of achieving lasting peace, fearing Russia's determination to retain control of captured territories. Meanwhile, Ukraine conducted extensive drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure in the Black Sea, targeting vessels connected to Russia’s “shadow fleet.” U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Putin in Moscow, with discussions centering on peace proposals for Ukraine, amid rising tensions regarding military strategies and territorial disputes.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China's navy continued to enhance its capabilities, posing a potential peer challenge to U.S. naval forces in the Pacific region. Japan and China experienced rising tensions following a coast guard incident in disputed waters, with both sides presenting conflicting accounts. Informal discussions between Japan and the Philippines centered on the potential export of missile technology, which may exacerbate relations with China. As the United States intensified its stance against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, global alliances around Venezuela's political situation were highlighted, with various nations indicating their positions. In India, the commissioning of the INS Aridhaman, the third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, marked a significant advancement in its naval deterrent capabilities. Additionally, geopolitical risks influenced the oil market, with prices remaining elevated in response to drone strikes on infrastructure in the Caspian region and ongoing tensions over Venezuela. Finally, NATO leadership suggested the need to analyze the possibility of pre-emptive strikes as a defensive strategy against Russia.</li>

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed that a deal with Syria was possible but insisted on establishing a buffer zone. Meanwhile, the Israeli military continued its operations in Gaza, conducting a drone strike that killed a Palestinian man, which violated a ceasefire agreement. Analysts asserted that Israeli military actions had not ceased despite a designated ceasefire. In cyber warfare, Iran-linked actors targeted multiple sectors within Israel, employing sophisticated tools to breach security. The situation remained tense as the U.S. envoy warned Iraq about the potential for an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah.</li>
