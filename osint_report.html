        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela, as President Donald Trump threatened a total blockade of Venezuelan oil amidst a backdrop of economic hardship and military activity. Trump announced on 16 December that the U.S. would impose a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers, claiming Venezuela's government operated as a "foreign terrorist organization." Concurrently, U.S. military engagements in the eastern Pacific resulted in the deaths of four individuals connected to alleged drug trafficking activities, contributing to a nearing death toll of approximately 100 from recent U.S. strikes. The U.S. House of Representatives rejected attempts to block military actions against Venezuela, further heightening the likelihood of direct military confrontations. Russia cautioned about the potential for escalation in the Caribbean and advocated for dialogue between the U.S. and Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro characterized U.S. intentions as efforts to overthrow his government and called the military buildup a threat to regional stability.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukraine ramped up its domestic arms production at a secret factory, focusing on manufacturing long-range missiles. Turkish air forces shot down a drone that entered Turkish airspace, prompting Turkey to caution both Russia and Ukraine about escalating tensions in the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing for another year of war, despite ongoing peace talks. EU leaders pressured Belgium to support the repurposing of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine, a topic debated at a summit in Brussels. The United States announced substantial arms sales to Taiwan, including high-mobility artillery rocket systems and tactical missile systems, which drew criticism from China. Meanwhile, the EU faced increasing tension over its plan to use about $246 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets to bolster Ukraine, with Russian officials threatening legal action against this move as theft.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a U.S. Navy warship in the Middle East launched a one-way attack drone, marking a significant milestone in the provision of cost-effective drone technology to American forces. On 24 October, China condemned the Philippines for allegedly intruding into the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao in the South China Sea, accusing Manila of "thief crying stop thief" tactics. Additionally, Taiwan's defense authority reported on 24 October that the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's aircraft carrier Fujian transited through the Taiwan Straits on 23 October, which experts suggested was a normal operational arrangement aimed at enhancing capabilities. In a related development, the Armed Forces of the Philippines continued their commitment to protect Filipino fisherfolk in the West Philippine Sea, underscoring regional security dynamics.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel launched a series of airstrikes on southern and northeastern Lebanon on 23 November, targeting Hezbollah infrastructure. The Israeli military confirmed these strikes were part of ongoing operations against the militant group as discussions for a ceasefire continued. In the context of geopolitical tension, Qatar's Prime Minister warned that Israeli ceasefire violations could jeopardize the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Meanwhile, U.S. Navy forces marked a milestone by deploying a one-way attack drone from a warship in the Middle East. In another significant development, Israel and Egypt signed a natural gas deal valued at approximately $35 billion, despite strains in their relations due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Additionally, in the UK, police arrested four individuals for making pro-Palestinian calls during protests as the Gaza death toll exceeded 70,000, further highlighting the region's escalating crisis.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that M23 fighters withdrew from Uvira, Democratic Republic of the Congo, as confirmed by footage showing military movements. In Nigeria, the government apologized over the detention of 11 air force personnel in Burkina Faso following an emergency landing; while the personnel were released, they had yet to return home. The conflict in Sudan intensified, evidenced by a drone strike that caused blackouts in major cities, and reports emerged alleging mass killings by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which faced accusations of attempting to conceal their actions. The humanitarian crisis in Sudan deepened, with millions facing severe food shortages and over 13.5 million people displaced since the conflict began in April 2023. Additionally, armed militias attacked a mine in Plateau State, Nigeria, resulting in at least 12 fatalities, further highlighting the deteriorating security situation in the region.</li>
