        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States seized a large oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela on 9 December. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the vessel was involved in shipping sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. The seizure escalated tensions between the Trump administration and the Venezuelan government, which condemned the action as an "act of international piracy." President Donald Trump announced the operation publicly, asserting it was part of a broader anti-drug strategy. In response, Venezuela's officials accused the U.S. of theft and called for international condemnation of the seizure. Russia reiterated its support for Venezuela, while the seizure contributed to rising oil prices amid concerns of further supply disruptions. Additionally, the Pentagon expressed that the U.S. military remains unprepared for a potential conflict with China, suggesting ongoing geopolitical vulnerabilities.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. On 11 December, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged the United Kingdom to disclose details regarding the activities of a British soldier killed in Ukraine, highlighting allegations of Britain's broader involvement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy convened urgent discussions with leaders from approximately 30 nations, emphasizing the need for continued support amid pressure for territorial concessions from both Russia and the United States.

Additionally, a Polish court detained a Russian archaeologist, wanted in Ukraine for illegally excavating an ancient site in Crimea.

The U.S. and Japan reaffirmed their commitment to regional security in response to increased military activity by China, which included joint flights with Russian bombers. A Pentagon report highlighted concerns about the U.S. military's ability to deter China in a potential conflict over Taiwan, indicating the United States would struggle due to China's rapid weapon production capabilities.

A severe winter storm, Storm Byron, struck the Gaza Strip, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis for displaced families living in flooded tent camps. Gaza activists accused Hamas of hoarding essential supplies, including baby formula, amid the ongoing hunger crisis, while Israel faced criticism for not adequately responding to the disaster affecting both Palestinians and its own citizens.

Additionally, U.S. Republican Senator John Kennedy expressed views suggesting South Africa should be excluded from a prominent trade initiative, reflecting rising tensions between the United States and South Africa. Notably, the aftermath of President Donald Trump's announced peace deal did not alleviate ongoing conflicts in the Congo and Rwanda, as concerns about the practical implications of this diplomacy grew.
