        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Venezuela banned six major airlines as tensions escalated due to warnings from the United States regarding military activity in the region. The Venezuelan aviation authority announced the ban on 26 November after several carriers ceased operations. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responded to increased military pressure from the U.S. by asserting the resilience of his nation, claiming that the U.S. "cannot defeat" Venezuela. Concurrently, reports highlighted an uptick in GPS jamming near Venezuelan territory amid increased U.S. naval operations. In Washington, D.C., heightened security concerns arose following the shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan national near the White House, raising questions about the potential threats posed by the 77,000 Afghans resettled in the U.S. Lastly, U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth declared a commitment to targeting "narco-terrorists" trafficking drugs into the U.S., signaling a firm stance in America's ongoing confrontations in the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated demands for Ukrainian territory, asserting readiness to fight until "the last Ukrainian dies." In anticipation of upcoming talks with a U.S. delegation scheduled for next week in Moscow, Putin stated that a U.S.-backed peace plan could serve as a general framework for future agreements, while simultaneously declaring it "legally impossible" to sign a peace treaty with Ukraine due to the perceived illegitimacy of its leadership. Ukrainian officials emphasized that any peace plan must ensure no future Russian aggression. The Russian judicial system convicted eight individuals to life imprisonment over a significant terrorist attack on the Kerch Bridge, an essential infrastructure link to Russian-annexed Crimea. In military developments, the Ukrainian Air Forces reported a surge in Russian drone activity, with 142 UAVs launched overnight. In a separate context, France announced a return to limited military service, with President Emmanuel Macron advocating for preparedness amid increasing tensions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia's "shadow vessels," which evaded international sanctions by using false flags, accounted for the transit of 113 ships in the first nine months of 2025. These vessels facilitated the shipment of approximately 5.4 million tonnes of Russian crude oil to India, valued at €2.1 billion, showing India's growing reliance on Russian petroleum amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, New Zealand's navy made a rare transit through the Taiwan Strait with the HMNZS Aotearoa, underscoring the strategic significance of the region. In Europe, despite the challenges faced by Ukraine, reports suggested that the country may have secured a potential path toward its desired freedom. Additionally, China's top diplomat urged France to strengthen China-EU relations ahead of a meeting between the two nations' leaders, reflecting ongoing global power shifts, particularly in the Red Sea region, where competition for influence continues to escalate among countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel intensified military operations in southern Lebanon, launching airstrikes on villages such as Jarmak and Mahmoudiya, a year after a ceasefire with Hezbollah. Israeli forces targeted what they described as Hezbollah's efforts to rearm, recording nearly 10,000 violations of the ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, on 24 October, Israel returned 15 Palestinian bodies to Gaza as part of a ceasefire agreement, though the remains of two additional hostages from the 7 October Hamas-led attack remained unreturned. Simultaneously, Hamas reportedly established a growing armed presence in Syria and assisted Hezbollah's efforts to rebuild military capabilities in southern Lebanon. Multiple reports suggested that Israel's violations of ceasefire agreements extended into Gaza as well, with ongoing airstrikes despite international calls for restraint.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Nigerian President Bola Tinubu declared a nationwide emergency on 25 October, responding to an uptick in mass abductions and violent attacks, including the kidnapping of schoolchildren. In Guinea-Bissau, a military coup took place on 25 October, with General Horta Nta Na Man installed as the new interim leader following the arrest of President Embalo and the suspension of the electoral process. The situation in Sudan remained critical, as reports surfaced about the killing of civilians amidst ongoing unrest, with the leadership in Sudan alleging that the United Arab Emirates had bought silence from Western leaders on these issues. Additionally, US President Donald Trump announced on 25 October that South Africa would be barred from the next G20 Summit in Miami and stated intentions to halt all US subsidies to the country over its treatment of American diplomats. The political landscape in Africa continued to shift, marked by increasing coups and unrest across various nations, including Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau.</li>
