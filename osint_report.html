        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments involving the United States and Venezuela. On 3 January, President Donald Trump explicitly stated his intention to control Venezuela's oil resources, affecting the energy landscape of the region. By 8 January, Trump suggested that U.S. oversight of Venezuela could persist for several years. Following a military operation that reportedly led to over 100 deaths, the U.S. confirmed its authority over Venezuelan oil sales. Trump's administration seized oil tankers with ties to Venezuela, escalating tensions in the region and drawing a strong warning from Russia in response to these actions. Furthermore, Trump's shifting stance towards Colombia became evident when he offered a friendly invitation to Colombian President Gustavo Petro after previously threatening military action against Colombia. Overall, these developments underscore a new assertive approach by the U.S. in Latin America, raising questions about broader implications for regional stability and international relations.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated several key military and geopolitical developments. President Donald Trump endorsed a sanctions bill aimed at crippling the Russian economy due to its ongoing war in Ukraine, as confirmed by Senator Lindsey Graham. A Russia-bound oil tanker was attacked by a drone in the Black Sea near Türkiye, highlighting increasing maritime tensions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the text of a security guarantee from the United States was nearing finalization amidst ongoing concerns over Western troop deployments in Ukraine, which Russia condemned as foreign intervention. Russian attacks resulted in widespread blackouts in the southeastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia. Additionally, Russia freed French political scholar Laurent Vinatier as part of a prisoner exchange, while claims of rising Russian military deaths were reported alongside the liberation of the Bratskoye settlement in Dnipropetrovsk. The geopolitical environment demonstrated increasing complexity and volatility, particularly with discussions regarding possible peacekeeping missions involving troops from France and the UK.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated heightened military and geopolitical tensions across Asia and the Pacific. The United States military seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker, which Moscow claimed violated international maritime laws. In response, China condemned the U.S. for the "arbitrary" action. Concurrently, Japan protested against China's gas drilling operations in the East China Sea, emphasizing the failure of cooperative negotiations that had previously aimed to manage shared resources. In the broader context, military spending surged across Asia, with China's defense budget reaching $320 billion, prompting significant increases in military allocations from countries like Japan in response to perceived security threats. Additionally, Japan prepared to conduct a rare earth mining test in the Pacific, aiming to reduce reliance on Chinese imports. Furthermore, Taiwan grounded its F-16 fighter jets for inspections following an accident, intensifying scrutiny on military readiness amid ongoing regional disputes.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in the Middle East. On 8 January, the Lebanese army announced it had completed the first phase of disarming non-state groups, including Hezbollah, in southern Lebanon. Israel condemned the operation as "insufficient," while concurrently conducting airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, resulting in casualties amid reported ceasefire violations. The Israeli military also responded to a misfired rocket from Gaza City with targeted strikes, claiming to have killed four individuals linked to a rocket launch site. Additionally, tensions grew as Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar condemned Syrian attacks on the Kurdish minority in Aleppo, labeling them as "serious and dangerous." Meanwhile, unrest in Iran continued to escalate, with protests driven by economic pressures challenging the political establishment. The complex interplay of these events underscores an increasingly volatile security landscape in the region.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that conflicts and geopolitical tensions persisted across various regions. In Venezuela, the U.S. military executed an operation leading to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, prompting discussions in Congress regarding military action that resulted in over 100 casualties. In Somalia, the U.S. suspended aid to the government after allegations surfaced that officials had seized U.S.-funded food supplies. The African Union (AU) demanded that Israel retract its recognition of Somaliland, signaling increasing geopolitical complexities in the region. Meanwhile, the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals ignited fierce competition among African football nations, with Nigeria facing Algeria and Morocco battling Cameroon, further intensifying national pride and regional rivalries.</li>
