        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. military operations in the Caribbean continued to target alleged drug trafficking vessels, resulting in a recent strike that killed three individuals, bringing the death toll from the anti-narcotics campaign to at least 70. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth emphasized that these attacks would persist until "narco-terrorists" ceased their activities. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate blocked multiple bipartisan resolutions aimed at constraining President Donald Trump's military authority in Venezuela, despite significant public opposition to military action in the region. The Senate voted 51-49 against proposals that would have required congressional approval for any strikes against Venezuela. Concurrently, reports emerged of increased U.S. surveillance operations over Mexico, signaling an escalation in the crackdown on drug cartels under the Trump administration.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that NATO Secretary General declared the alliance made significant progress in producing ammunition, highlighting efforts to counterbalance Russia's previous advantages. Russian oil revenues declined, totaling 7.5 trillion rubles from January to October 2025, amidst newly imposed U.S. sanctions. The persistence of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine continued to dominate discussions, as Ukraine's frontline constraints manifested in stories of young recruits like Mykola Lebedev preparing for battle. Tensions escalated as Russia accused NATO and Ukraine of planning a nuclear sabotage at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, prompting warnings from the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. In related developments, Colombia's judicial system convicted two Colombians for their participation in fighting alongside Ukraine, sentencing them to 13 years each. North Korea remained active, launching ballistic missiles towards its eastern waters while deepening military discussions with Russia. This convergence of military and geopolitical activities underscores a complex global security landscape defined by conflicts and strategic alliances.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China officially commissioned its third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, following extensive sea trials. This development, reported on 7 November, marked a significant milestone for Beijing as it aimed to enhance its naval capabilities and project military power beyond its coastline. Meanwhile, North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile on 7 November, which South Korean military officials reported as a provocative response to new U.S. sanctions. This missile test served as a defiance of recent diplomatic efforts by the United States and illustrated North Korea's continuous arms development activities. Additionally, Typhoon Kalmaegi struck Vietnam, resulting in extensive damage across central provinces and affecting power supply for approximately 1.2 million residents, with initial reports indicating at least five fatalities.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Kazakhstan announced its intention to join the Abraham Accords with Israel on 6 November, a move primarily viewed as symbolic in support of former President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace initiative. Subsequently, Israel intensified its military operations in Gaza, with Defense Minister Israel Katz directing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to dismantle all Hamas tunnels and infrastructure. Concurrently, President Trump stated at a White House event that an international stabilization force would be deployed to Gaza "very soon" amidst ongoing clashes and severe humanitarian conditions in the region. In other developments, the United States prepared to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus, Syria, as part of efforts to negotiate a security agreement between Israel and Syria. Additionally, Israeli forces conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, prompting condemnation from President Joseph Aoun of Lebanon.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Kazakhstan announced its intention to join the Abraham Accords with Israel, marking a symbolic boost for the initiative originally promoted by former President Donald Trump. In Sudan, the ongoing conflict between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) intensified, contributing to over 150,000 reported deaths and widespread atrocities, while the RSF agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by mediators. In Nigeria, violence against Christians persisted, with recent attacks by Fulanis resulting in the deaths of a pastor and nine others in Benue State. Outside powers reportedly continued to back warring factions in Sudan, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, Japan extended the deployment of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in the Middle East as part of ongoing antipiracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, signaling a continued commitment to regional security.</li>
