        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments involving the United States and Latin America. The Trump administration canceled citizenship ceremonies for migrants from 19 countries affected by travel bans, citing national security concerns. In a related move, it halted all immigration applications for these nations, including Afghanistan, Iran, and Somalia, leaving thousands in legal limbo. Tensions escalated in Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro rejected US military and political pressure while relying on support from Russia and China. The administration announced plans for airstrikes on drug traffickers in the Caribbean, asserting any nation involved in drug trafficking could face military action. Concurrently, allegations of war crimes surfaced against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding strikes on suspected drug boats, heightening scrutiny of the US’s military operations in the region. Furthermore, Colombia's President Gustavo Petro accused the US of murder following the death of a fisherman in a US maritime strike, leading to legal complaints against US officials.</li>

In diplomatic developments, French President Emmanuel Macron initiated a three-day state visit to China to discuss trade ties and ongoing hostilities in Ukraine.

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated several significant military and geopolitical developments. In the South China Sea, China's legal maneuvers were reshaping regional dynamics and heightening global business risks. Concurrently, 19 Chinese warships were spotted in the West Philippine Sea, raising concerns in the Philippine Navy. The Chinese company CNOOC commenced production at its Weizhou 11-4 project, targeting a plateau output of approximately 16,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2026. In Venezuela, a U.S. court mandated the forced sale of Citgo to settle debts, which the Venezuelan government criticized as part of a broader U.S. military buildup against it. Malaysia, over a decade after the disappearance of Flight MH370, announced plans to resume its search operations on 30 December in a targeted area of the Indian Ocean. Additionally, Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi appeared to challenge China's territorial claims by approaching sensitive issues related to Taiwan.

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel announced its intention to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing, reopening it as part of a U.S.-backed ceasefire agreement. Israeli authorities indicated that this crossing would open in the coming days, but only for Palestinians wishing to exit Gaza. Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions urging Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which Israel's ambassador to the UN described as a reflection of the assembly's detachment from reality. In parallel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed for a security buffer zone extending into Syria, an initiative met with firm rejection from Lebanese officials. Amid ongoing hostilities, Israeli forces reportedly killed over 350 Palestinians during the last 50 days of ceasefire in Gaza.
