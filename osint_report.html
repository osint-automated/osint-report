        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump announced that Venezuela would transfer between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil to the United States at market price, with revenues controlled by his administration. Concurrently, U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker linked to Venezuela in the North Atlantic, underscoring ongoing military operations in the region. This operation followed a previous pursuit of a blockade-running tanker associated with Venezuela’s oil sanctions. Additionally, Trump faced criticism for comments about acquiring Greenland, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarifying that Trump preferred a purchase to military invasion. The U.S. military's actions have drawn scrutiny, particularly regarding its implications for military relations with regional players, notably Colombia, and U.S. demands for Venezuela to sever ties with Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba. The allegations of interference in Venezuelan oil exports have sparked debates over U.S. intentions and strategies in the region, especially as oil prices decline.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict on day 1,413 of the war. Ukraine’s Chief of Staff Kyrylo Budanov reported "concrete results" from discussions with Western allies at a summit in Paris. Concurrently, Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the downing of a U.S.-made HIMARS rocket and 106 drones. Ukraine received troop commitments from the UK and France for future deployments in the event of a peace deal, despite Moscow's opposition. In a related move, U.S. officials expressed intentions to lead a ceasefire monitoring mechanism with European participation if a peace agreement is reached. Additionally, talks among U.S. and Ukrainian representatives focused on security guarantees, following a draft statement from the Coalition of the Willing that promised binding commitments to Ukraine's defense. Meanwhile, Russia reported the elimination of over 425 Ukrainian soldiers in recent clashes, underscoring the ongoing intensity of the conflict.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Japan condemned China's ban on dual-use exports for military applications as "absolutely unacceptable" on 6 January 2026, amidst concerns over potential curbs on vital rare earth materials. On the same day, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung requested Chinese leader Xi Jinping's assistance in curbing North Korea's nuclear program, proposing a "feasible" freeze on weapons development. The geopolitical landscape further shifted as the U.S. intensified its interests in Greenland for rare earth minerals and strategic military positioning, alarming European allies. Simultaneously, China's top diplomat visited eastern Africa to bolster China's influence in the region. In the context of U.S.-China relations, the removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces was framed as a potential shift in power dynamics that could challenge U.S. rivals and drug cartels.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Syria and Israel agreed to form a joint mechanism for intelligence sharing and military de-escalation. In Lebanon, Israeli forces engaged in offensive actions that resulted in the deaths of two individuals, occurring just before a scheduled meeting of truce monitors from France, Israel, Lebanon, the United States, and the United Nations. Analysts expressed concerns that ongoing Israeli attacks in Lebanon could hinder efforts to disarm Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the Syrian army closed Kurdish areas in Aleppo, designating them as 'closed military zones,' amid reports of violence following failed negotiations to integrate Kurdish forces into state institutions. The Israeli military conducted strikes on multiple targets in southern and eastern Lebanon, which included residential areas, in a significant violation of a long-standing ceasefire. Additionally, the United Nations condemned Israel for discriminatory practices in the occupied West Bank, labeling actions there as violations of international law. In northern Syria, thousands of displaced people faced harsh winter conditions following severe snowstorms, further complicating the humanitarian situation in the region.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Nigeria's national football team, led by Frank Onyeka, advanced to the quarter-finals of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) after defeating Mozambique. In Burkina Faso, security officials announced the successful thwarting of a plot to assassinate leader Capt Traoré, claiming that neighboring Ivory Coast financed this attempt. Reports also emerged from Sudan, detailing systematic gang rapes attributed to the Rapid Support Forces, with victims including infants. In the Central African Republic, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, viewed as a key ally of Russia, was declared the winner of a contested election, raising concerns over the legitimacy of the electoral process. Additionally, the U.S. government implemented a new visa bond requirement of up to $15,000 for B1/B2 visa applicants from Nigeria, among other countries, as part of an expanded immigration enforcement strategy.</li>
