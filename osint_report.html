        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump announced plans to 'permanently pause migration' from all 'Third World Countries' in response to the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. on 24 October. This decision followed an Afghan national being identified as a suspect in the incident. In conjunction with the migration pause, the Trump administration initiated a rigorous review of green card applications from 19 nations deemed 'countries of concern' and established heightened scrutiny for Afghan nationals. Additionally, President Trump vowed to begin land-based military operations against Venezuelan drug trafficking networks, citing a significant reduction in maritime trafficking and escalating U.S.-Venezuela tensions. Venezuela's government responded by banning six international airlines from its airspace, reflecting the deteriorating diplomatic relations with the U.S. The geopolitical landscape surrounding both Venezuela and immigration policy remained tense, with potential implications for regional security and U.S. foreign policy.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly pledged to continue purchasing Russian oil, defying EU sanctions while attending a Kremlin meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Oil prices rose as Putin suggested that US-Ukraine proposals could lead to a peace deal, though heavy fighting persisted in Ukraine. Ukrainian military sources reported that Russian forces used drone tactics reminiscent of "aircraft carriers," effectively extending their attack range. Concurrently, anti-corruption investigations targeted top Ukrainian officials, notably raiding the home and office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. In military developments, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry reported significant casualties, with over 1,710 soldiers lost in recent engagements. Meanwhile, NATO allies contemplated "offensive cyber operations" against Russia amid heightened tensions, while concerns over recruiting efforts by Russian forces surfaced in Jordan following fatalities among its citizens. Overall, the landscape around the Russia-Ukraine conflict reflected ongoing military escalation and internal political challenges within Ukraine.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated several significant military and geopolitical developments. From 23 to 27 November, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted military operations in the Bohai Strait and parts of the northern Yellow Sea, generating speculation that these drills served as a warning to Japan. Meanwhile, in response to an influx of Chinese research vessels in the Indian Ocean, India enlarged its designated missile test danger zone off Visakhapatnam from 1 to 4 December. Concurrently, Russia’s oil and gas revenues collapsed by 35% in November 2025 to $6.6 billion, attributed to new U.S. sanctions targeting major companies and plummeting Urals crude prices. Additionally, the European Union continued to push for the Trans-Caspian corridor despite growing disillusionment, while China financed much of its infrastructure.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israeli forces conducted a deadly raid in southern Syria on 13 October, killing at least 13 individuals in an operation targeting an Islamist group, marking one of the deadliest military actions since the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. On the same day, Israeli airstrikes claimed the lives of several individuals in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, following the extrajudicial killings of two Palestinians in Jenin, which further escalated tensions in the region. Reports from Damascus countryside confirmed clashes between Israeli forces and local residents, resulting in multiple casualties. Israel's recent military operations have drawn condemnation from Syria’s foreign ministry, which characterized the attacks as a "horrific massacre," especially citing the inclusion of women and children among the fatalities. Additionally, Israeli authorities began investigating their soldiers for the killings of two surrendering Palestinians in the West Bank, amid ongoing clashes that illustrate Israel's heightened military activities across multiple fronts.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump announced plans to "permanently pause migration" from all countries he classified as "Third World" following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. by an Afghan national. In response to this incident, the Trump administration ordered a rigorous review of green cards held by permanent residents from 19 designated "countries of concern." Concurrently, in Sudan, Lt. Gen. Yasser al-Atta accused the United Arab Emirates of supporting the Rapid Support Forces with funding and mercenaries to exacerbate ethnic tensions within the country. Additionally, Nigeria condemned a military coup in Guinea-Bissau and successfully evacuated former President Goodluck Jonathan from the region amid electoral turmoil.</li>
