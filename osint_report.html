        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed a significant strike on a dock facility in Venezuela, marking the first known U.S. military operation on Venezuelan soil aimed at disrupting drug trafficking. The CIA reportedly conducted a drone strike on this facility, used by the Tren de Aragua gang for loading narcotics. The Pentagon also executed its 30th strike on alleged drug vessels since early September, resulting in at least 107 confirmed fatalities. Concurrently, the U.S. Coast Guard maintained pursuit of an oil tanker with a painted Russian flag, intensifying efforts against sanctioned shipments tied to Venezuela. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated Moscow’s support for China's stance on Taiwan, further complicating the geopolitical landscape. Meanwhile, Iran expressed gratitude for Iraq’s mediation proposals while emphasizing that negotiations with the U.S. must follow established diplomatic protocols.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukraine signaled a withdrawal of its NATO membership bid, impacting European defense shares and potentially benefitting diversified defense ETFs. On 24 October, Russia's Ministry of Defense announced that its nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile system had entered active service. Tensions escalated as a top Russian security official issued personal threats against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, following Russian claims that Ukraine attacked a presidential residence, which Zelenskyy denied as a fabrication intended to justify retaliation. Reports illustrated a steep rise in Russian military casualties as the U.S. continued to advocate for a peace deal. Meanwhile, Russia announced the activation of its Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater drone, adding to its military capabilities. In diplomatic matters, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern regarding the alleged drone attack on Putin's residence, suggesting dialogue as a path toward resolving the conflict.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China's People's Liberation Army conducted the second day of extensive military drills around Taiwan, known as "Justice Mission 2025," on 30 December. The exercises included 10 hours of live-fire maneuvers, during which China deployed fighter jets, warships, and new amphibious assault ships, simulating a blockade of key Taiwanese ports. The drills aimed to demonstrate China's ability to cut off Taiwan from outside support in a potential conflict scenario. Taiwan condemned the exercises as "highly provocative and reckless," while Donald Trump suggested that an invasion was unlikely. The United States viewed the drills as a strong warning against its support for Taiwan and an effort to counter military cooperation between the U.S. and Japan.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. US President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida, where he threatened militant groups Hamas and Iran, insisting Hamas must disarm to proceed with the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire. Trump indicated support for Israeli military action against Iran should it continue its nuclear and missile programs. Concurrently, Turkey detained 357 suspected members of ISIS following attacks that resulted in the deaths of three police officers in Yalova. In a related diplomatic context, Somalia’s President visited Turkey to discuss cooperation and counterterrorism after Israel recognized the sovereignty of Somaliland, prompting demonstrations in Somalia against this recognition. Lastly, Iranian officials warned of severe retaliation in response to threats of military action from the US.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia visited Turkey for discussions with Turkish officials on 30 December regarding increased cooperation and Somalia's efforts against terrorism. This visit occurred shortly after Israel recognized the independence of Somaliland, provoking public demonstrations in Somalia as the government sought international diplomatic support. The United Nations Security Council condemned Israel's recognition during an emergency meeting, asserting that it undermined peace prospects in the region, while South Africa labeled the move as 'cynical.' Concurrently, the ongoing civil war in Sudan continued to impact the population severely, as international aid workers reported alarming rates of malnutrition among children fleeing conflict, particularly in el-Fasher. In military developments, Saudi Arabia conducted airstrikes in Mukalla, Yemen, targeting shipments of weapons intended for separatist forces, exacerbating tensions in the region.</li>
