The U.S. military conducted operations in the Indian Ocean, boarding a sanctioned oil tanker after a pursuit originating from the Caribbean, amidst accusations of "piracy" related to its blockade of Venezuelan oil. In Cuba, Russian officials promised to provide "all possible assistance" as the U.S. tightened its embargo, which has severely affected Cuba's fuel supplies. Additionally, Transparency International reported a decline in anti-corruption efforts among established democracies, including the United States, which recorded its lowest score under the current methodology. Cuban officials accused the U.S. of trying to undermine the political resolve of Cubans, while the U.S. State Department insisted its oil restrictions were not exacerbating the humanitarian situation on the island.</li>

The U.S. government viewed the Russian aircraft deal with Algeria as problematic, threatening potential sanctions. On the diplomatic front, the Kremlin confirmed the restoration of technical-level dialogue with Paris and announced no date was set for the next round of peace talks on Ukraine. In NATO's eastern front, U.S. Vice President JD Vance pledged nearly $9 billion in potential investments to Armenia, Russia’s former ally, as Japan signed up for NATO’s Ukraine arms pipeline.
