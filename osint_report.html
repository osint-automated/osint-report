        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. A Kremlin official asserted that the Russian navy planned to prevent Western powers from seizing merchant ships carrying Russian oil, describing such actions as "piracy-like attacks." The Trump administration escalated its war on drugs, conducting lethal maritime strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, resulting in at least 145 fatalities since September. Additionally, the U.S. military executed strikes on three alleged drug boats, killing 11 individuals and continuing to enforce a blockade on illicit oil shipments from Venezuela, where the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared under pressure from U.S. interests to ensure her administration's success. In the Gulf of Oman, Russia, China, and Iran commenced joint naval exercises, further complicating the regional security landscape. Additionally, the United States appointed a new envoy focused on Tibetan human rights, drawing criticism from China, which accused the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia intensified its hybrid warfare efforts, particularly against Poland and NATO, utilizing tactics such as rail sabotage, drone assaults, and cyber strikes. Polish officials highlighted concerns about "disposable agents" creating fear and undermining support for Ukraine. In Geneva, Switzerland, US-mediated peace talks between Ukraine and Russia resumed but concluded on 18 February with no meaningful progress after just two hours. Both sides described the negotiations as challenging, with Ukraine accusing Russia of delaying tactics. Amidst these developments, Ukrainian forces reported significant territorial gains, reclaiming over 200 square kilometers from Russian control. Additionally, a controversial decision allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under their flags at the 2026 Paralympics, which provoked strong reactions from Ukrainian officials.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China stockpiled 1.1 to 1.2 billion barrels of crude oil, enough to sustain its economy and military for three months without imports, signaling preparations for potential conflict over Taiwan. The Philippines and the United States reaffirmed their alliance, emphasizing a commitment to defend freedom of navigation in light of escalating tensions in the South China Sea. In addition, the U.S. expanded missile deployments in northern Philippines, positioning missile systems within 1,000+ miles of Chinese military assets. Russia, China, and Iran conducted joint naval exercises in the Gulf of Oman, showcasing their military cooperation amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats in Latin America killed 11 individuals, raising the total death toll to at least 145 since September.</li>

Israel conducted military actions, resulting in the deaths of two individuals in Gaza, while thousands struggled to exit for medical care through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. International pressure had little effect on Israel's policies, with over 80 UN member states condemning Israel's annexation of West Bank land and militants in Gaza preparing for a potential escalation amid a fragile ceasefire. In the political realm, Australia barred a citizen affiliated with ISIS from returning from Syria, while Turkey's parliament discussed advancing peace processes regarding the PKK. Iranian and US officials indicated progress in nuclear negotiations despite ongoing tensions, and multiple artistic figures criticized the Berlin Film Festival for remaining silent on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.

In South Africa, authorities faced backlash from residents in Johannesburg following comments made by a senior politician amid an ongoing water crisis in the city's struggling infrastructure. Meanwhile, Gabonese authorities enforced an indefinite suspension of Facebook and TikTok, citing risks to social cohesion. The UN refugee agency launched a $1.6 billion appeal to support millions affected by the ongoing war in Sudan, which continued to drive regional displacement amid a humanitarian crisis. Additionally, Burkina Faso's foreign minister reported that Russian instructors had aided the country in reclaiming 74% of territory from militant groups.</li>
