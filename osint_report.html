        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Canada lost its measles elimination status due to more than 5,000 reported cases linked to ongoing outbreaks and declining childhood vaccination rates. In geopolitical tensions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed doubts about the United Kingdom’s ability to distance itself from an alleged provocation involving the attempted hijacking of a Russian MiG-31 fighter jet. The United States escalated its military presence in the Caribbean, deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and conducting maritime strikes against suspected drug traffickers off the coast of Venezuela, as tensions with the Venezuelan government increased. Officials reported that the Venezuelan military prepared a guerrilla response to potential U.S. attacks, reinforcing the militarization of the region. In a related vein, Lavrov criticized U.S. military actions in Latin America, suggesting that Washington should focus on domestic issues in Belgium instead of interfering in Venezuela.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a significant escalation in military activities and geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Ukrainian intelligence revealed that nearly 300 Russian troops succumbed to low-quality food and drug abuse over the past two years, raising questions about troop morale and logistics. In response to increasing drone threats, counter-drone firm DroneShield reported a surge in demand for its products, particularly as drones disrupted activities in both Ukraine and Western nations. Russian forces intensified their operations near Pokrovsk, Ukraine, capturing the eastern part of Kupyansk, while also claiming to have thwarted a Ukrainian-British plot to hijack a MiG-31 fighter jet. Concurrently, Belgium experienced a series of mysterious drone incidents, prompting officials to scrutinize defenses amid allegations of Russian involvement. The United States urged NATO allies to cease purchases of Russian energy, aiming to apply further economic pressure on Moscow. These developments reflect an evolving battlefield scenario and highlight the growing complexity of international relations surrounding the conflict.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Typhoon Fung-wong resulted in at least 18 deaths and significant destruction in the northwestern Philippines before moving toward Taiwan, where authorities evacuated 3,000 residents in anticipation of the storm. Concurrently, Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sparked a diplomatic dispute with China by suggesting that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan might prompt a military response from Tokyo, marking a shift in Japan's long-standing diplomatic stance. On the military front, India accelerated its naval modernization by commissioning a new vessel every 40 days, reflecting its drive for self-reliance in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, China showcased its military capabilities by publicly displaying its operational GJ-11 unmanned combat aerial vehicle alongside J-20 and J-16D fighters during the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s 76th anniversary. Additionally, the newly launched Chinese aircraft carrier increased Beijing's ability to project naval power in the region.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Yemen's Houthi rebels signaled they had ceased attacks on Israel and maritime shipping in the Red Sea, amidst a tenuous ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa ruled out immediate talks with Israel regarding normalization of relations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) revealed intelligence on Hezbollah's terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon and conducted targeted strikes against key locations. Reports indicated that Israeli air strikes in Gaza had resulted in civilian casualties, challenging the ceasefire agreement. The U.S. administration revealed plans for rebuilding Gaza, while Israeli parliament advanced a bill proposing the death penalty for individuals deemed terrorists, potentially impacting Palestinians convicted of violence against Israelis. Meanwhile, Iraq held general elections under unusually calm circumstances, observed closely by both Iranian and American officials. In a separate development, Syrian President al-Sharaa pledged cooperation in combating ISIL as Syria joined the U.S.-led coalition against the group.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States government paid Equatorial Guinea $7.5 million to accept deportees, drawing criticism from a Democratic Senator who described the payment as “highly unusual.” Al-Qaeda-linked group JNIM besieged Mali’s capital, Bamako, cutting off key supply routes and causing significant fuel shortages. In Sudan, approximately 89,000 civilians fled El Fasher amidst escalating violence, with UN aid operations nearing collapse due to insecurity and depleted supplies. Meanwhile, Nigeria aimed to boost its oil output by approving 43 new oil and gas field development plans worth $20 billion, targeting a recovery from years of losses attributed to theft and mismanagement.</li>
