        <li><b>China:</b> During the reporting period, Nvidia became the world's first company to achieve a market capitalization of $5 trillion on 25 October, following a 5% increase in its stock price on Wall Street. This milestone occurred just three months after the company reached a $4 trillion valuation. In geopolitical developments, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed confidence in securing a trade deal during his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, scheduled for 27 October. Ahead of this meeting, China's state-owned COFCO made significant purchases of three U.S. soybean cargoes, marking a notable trade activity amidst ongoing tensions between the nations.

In the Gaza Strip, Israel resumed airstrikes, resulting in over 100 Palestinian fatalities, including at least 35 children, despite a recently brokered ceasefire by the United States. Following accusations of ceasefire violations by Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered these strikes and claimed the ceasefire remained intact, a position echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump. However, the violence raised doubts about the durability of peace agreements in the region, as tensions escalated with both sides trading blame for the breaches. Concurrently, discussions between Syria and Israel neared completion regarding a security framework that may involve joint oversight from U.S. forces.</li>

Concurrently, Israel escalated its military operations in Lebanon, launching drone strikes that resulted in the deaths of at least 10 individuals, including civilians and senior Hezbollah commanders, thereby violating ceasefire agreements. Additionally, tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan intensified as talks to dismantle the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) faltered amid deep mistrust, indicating the potential for broader conflict in the region. In terms of infrastructure, Iran commenced test flights of a domestically produced cargo plane aimed at bolstering its military and commercial capabilities. As these incidents unfolded, analysts voiced concerns over the implications for international relations and stability in the Middle East and surrounding regions.</li>

        <li><b>North Korea:</b> During the reporting period, U.S. President Donald Trump visited South Korea amid escalating military tensions, as North Korea conducted cruise missile tests in the Yellow Sea shortly before his arrival on 29 October. North Korean state media described the tests as demonstrations of military capability directed at perceived enemies, coinciding with Trump's ongoing discussions on trade and international relations. While in South Korea, Trump expressed optimism regarding a potential trade deal worth $350 billion, finalizing negotiations that may alleviate some tariffs on South Korean goods. Despite high-level talks with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, speculation about a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not materialize due to timing issues, as Trump confirmed he could not arrange a summit during his visit. Additionally, South Korea presented Trump with its highest national honors, including a gold crown, to commemorate the strengthening alliance amidst ongoing geopolitical challenges in the region.</li>
