Concurrently, U.S. Southern Command Commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan made a surprise visit to Caracas, Venezuela, to meet with Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president, signaling growing diplomatic engagement with the interim authorities following the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia implemented makeshift defenses, including anti-drone nets, to protect its fuel tanks from Ukrainian attacks; however, a recent offensive demonstrated the ineffectiveness of these measures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized ongoing peace talks with Russia, asserting they yielded little progress, while U.S. Senators visited Odesa, Ukraine, to emphasize bipartisan support for the nation. NATO conducted military exercises in Germany, showcasing readiness against Russian aggression as Turkish naval forces employed armed drones for the first time. Moreover, intelligence reports revealed that over 1,000 Kenyans were recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine under false pretenses.

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Iran and the United States escalated military posturing as negotiations over Iran's nuclear program stalled. Iran conducted live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz in collaboration with Russia, while the U.S. moved the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford closer to the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions contributed to a rise in oil prices, reflecting market concerns about supply disruptions amid ongoing military developments. In the South China Sea, a senior Philippine Navy official reported on China's illegal maritime presence in the country’s exclusive economic zone, amidst joint naval exercises with Philippine and allied forces. In Japan, the ruling party achieved a supermajority, enabling Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to potentially pursue constitutional reforms.

President Donald Trump convened the first meeting of his newly formed Board of Peace, where he announced that member countries had pledged $7 billion for Gaza reconstruction and the U.S. would contribute $10 billion. In Gaza, Hamas reasserted its control over security and public services despite suffering heavy losses in its conflict with Israel. The Israeli Defense Forces struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon amid rising regional tensions, and incidents of violence in the occupied West Bank resulted in the death of a 19-year-old Palestinian American by Israeli settlers. The United Nations expressed concerns over Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank, citing fears of ethnic cleansing.
