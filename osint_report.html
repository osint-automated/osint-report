Concurrently, the U.S. military intensified operations against alleged drug trafficking vessels, conducting multiple strikes in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which resulted in multiple casualties. Experts raised concerns about the potential for a U.S. invasion or coup attempt against Maduro's government, prompted by the accumulation of U.S. forces near Venezuela and aggressive military actions in the region.
