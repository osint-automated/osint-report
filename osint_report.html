        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. military increased its operations in the Caribbean, particularly around Puerto Rico, in response to escalating tensions with Venezuela. The Pentagon confirmed the deployment of significant military assets, including the largest aircraft carrier, to the northern Caribbean, and a new initiative, dubbed "Operation Southern Spear," aimed at combatting drug trafficking networks, was announced. Concurrently, U.S. officials reported a record number of cocaine seizures and confirmed the deaths of four individuals from recent strikes on vessels suspected of drug smuggling. President Donald Trump indicated that a decision on military action against Venezuela was imminent, stating he had "sort of" made up his mind while senior officials conducted meetings to discuss potential strategies. Additionally, there was a notable legal development as the family of a Colombian fisherman killed in one of the strikes announced plans to pursue legal action.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the premier of Saxony, Germany, advocated for resuming Russian energy imports following the conclusion of the Ukraine war. Ukraine's military claimed responsibility for a strike on a Russian oil refinery in the Ryazan region near Moscow, aiming to disrupt Russian energy capabilities amidst ongoing conflict. Concurrently, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine initiated an overhaul of the nation's energy sector, driven by revelations of a significant corruption scandal leading to the embezzlement of over $100 million. This prompted an urgent need for new management and audits within state-owned energy firms, as eight NATO members pledged €430 million in military aid to Ukraine amid these developments. Tensions remained high, with Russian missile strikes on Kyiv resulting in casualties, as Ukraine accused Russia of escalating attacks against civilian targets. In diplomatic circles, US Vice President J.D. Vance emphasized the need for direct negotiations between Presidents Trump and Putin to foster peace, while concerns about endemic corruption in Ukraine prompted EU scrutiny.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China unveiled the largest facility of its kind on a 10,000-foot plateau, with plans for expansion over the next three years. China issued a travel warning for its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan amid rising tensions following remarks from Tokyo's new premier regarding Taiwan. In military developments, China's People's Liberation Army Navy conducted the first sea trial of its Type 076 amphibious assault ship named Sichuan, departing from Shanghai on 14 November. Former U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien assessed that U.S.-China relations could remain stable unless Beijing launched military actions against Taiwan or the Philippines. Furthermore, officials convened at the BRICS–Europe forum in Sochi, Russia, emphasizing a geopolitical shift toward Eurasia.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Iran confirmed the seizure of the Talara tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, attesting that it carried unauthorized cargo bound for Singapore. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) stated that this action was taken based on a judicial order amid heightened regional tensions following the prior June conflict involving Israel and the United States. Concurrently, representatives from Syrian civil society and European Union officials conducted rare discussions in Damascus, focusing on the country's political future after President Bashar al-Assad's regime. In Gaza, ongoing humanitarian crises continued, with reports of Israeli military presence in over half of the territory and allegations of deliberate disruption of aid operations by Israel. The United Nations warned against Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty due to the construction of a concrete wall that crossed the Blue Line, further escalating regional tensions.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that on 15 November, the United Nations Security Council delayed its vote to renew the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei, which is crucial for maintaining peace between Sudan and South Sudan. Meanwhile, Sudan's army reportedly captured two areas in North Kordofan while the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) engaged in burning and burying bodies near sensitive locations in El Fasher. In a significant geopolitical development, French President Emmanuel Macron endorsed the recently signed peace agreement in Doha between the Democratic Republic of Congo and M23 rebels, labeling it a promising step towards peace. In military updates, investigative reports spotlighted a group allegedly facilitating ‘trafficking’ flights from Gaza to South Africa, raising concerns among Palestinian authorities over potential human trafficking networks aligned with Israel.</li>
