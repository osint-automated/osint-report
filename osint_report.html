        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in Mexico following the death of Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). On 23 February, Mexican security forces, aided by U.S. intelligence, killed Oseguera in Jalisco state, resulting in immediate and widespread violence that claimed at least 73 lives. In response, authorities deployed 10,000 soldiers nationwide to restore order, particularly in areas experiencing violent clashes, including Guadalajara, Jalisco. The violence also prompted the escape of 23 inmates from a prison in Puerto Vallarta, and American tourists reported chaotic scenes in popular resort areas amid heightened cartel activity. The Chinese Embassy in Mexico issued a security advisory, urging nationals to remain vigilant. As unrest persisted, the Mexican President urged citizens to stay calm, while concerns grew about the potential spillover of violence into the United States, especially affecting border areas.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the war in Ukraine marked its fourth anniversary on 24 February, with ongoing discussions about a ceasefire yielding no conclusive outcomes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the nation’s resilience and noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin had failed to achieve his war objectives. While Russian attacks continued to impact infrastructure, particularly energy systems, reports emerged revealing extreme military discipline on the Russian side, including alleged executions of soldiers for disobedience. Geopolitically, NATO enhanced its readiness to deter further Russian aggression through troop exercises in Putlos, Germany, as speculation arose over potential nuclear weapon transfers from the UK and France to Ukraine. Additionally, tensions involving China surfaced, as CIA briefings warned of possible military action against Taiwan by 2027. Casualties from the Ukraine conflict reached alarming figures, with the UN reporting over 15,000 civilian deaths, including 763 children.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. military carried out a strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean Sea, resulting in the deaths of three individuals on 24 October. This operation formed part of a prolonged campaign against drug trafficking under the Trump administration. The Royal Australian Navy’s HMAS Toowoomba completed its second transit of the South China Sea as part of a regional presence deployment. Japan announced plans to install surface-to-air missile systems on a remote island near Taiwan by March 2031, marking the first specific timeline for such deployment. Additionally, Iran's Dena destroyer participated in the MILAN 2026 Naval Exercise in India, which included the involvement of 72 countries. Meanwhile, reports surfaced of heightened tensions in the English Channel due to Russian oil tankers, raising concerns about potential maritime confrontations.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a military helicopter crash in Dorcheh, Isfahan province, Iran, resulted in the deaths of four individuals, including two pilots and two merchants, following a recent fighter jet crash in Hamadan province. In response to rising tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. State Department ordered non-essential staff to leave its embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, while indirect negotiations with Iran were scheduled for Geneva on 28 October. Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich threatened to occupy Gaza completely if Hamas did not disarm, coinciding with the investigation revealing extensive Israeli military violence against medics in Gaza and a report detailing Israeli military incursions into Syria. Meanwhile, the Pentagon reported that U.S. military forces boarded a third Iranian-sanctioned oil tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracing it from the Caribbean. Geopolitical analysts expressed concern that any U.S. attack on Iran could trigger significant retaliatory actions, potentially destabilizing the region further.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that significant military and geopolitical developments occurred across various regions. In Africa, Chad closed its border with Sudan to prevent violence from spreading into its territory, while Iran's defense minister emphasized the country's intent to strengthen ties with West African nations like Burkina Faso. Renewed conflict in South Sudan's Jonglei state displaced nearly 280,000 people, eliciting warnings from the UN about a "perfect storm" of humanitarian crises. South Africa announced the repatriation of 11 nationals tricked into fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Additionally, Iran's Dena destroyer participated in the MILAN 2026 Naval Exercise in India, joining forces with 72 other countries. These events highlighted the dynamic and often volatile nature of military and geopolitical alliances in the region.</li>
