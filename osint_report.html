        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. Military planned to cut support to the Boy Scouts and that a judge dismissed indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Additionally, the top U.S. military adviser toured the Caribbean to reinforce pressure on Venezuela, where the ongoing military buildup suggested possible imminent conflict. Documents revealed plans to maintain U.S. troops in the Caribbean through 2028, amid assertions from eight Republican lawmakers that military intervention in Venezuela was a viable option driven by oil interests. The U.S. enhanced its military operations in the Caribbean, launching airstrikes on alleged drug trafficking boats, which resulted in casualties. Meanwhile, Venezuela rejected the U.S. designation of its national cartel as terrorists, framing it as a tactic to justify military intervention. As tensions escalated, U.S. military forces closely monitored movements near Venezuelan airspace, corroborating the heavy military presence in the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia launched multiple attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in at least seven deaths from overnight strikes that targeted city buildings and energy infrastructure. Concurrently, a Ukrainian operation in southern Russia led to three fatalities. As these attacks unfolded, Ukraine's national security adviser confirmed that the country had agreed to a peace deal with the U.S. that outlined core terms for de-escalation in the conflict. While talks progressed, the Kremlin characterized the ongoing discussions as an "information frenzy" and refrained from clarifying its position on the negotiations. U.S. officials reported that secret meetings took place in Abu Dhabi between U.S. and Russian delegations regarding the peace proposal. Despite these developments, skepticism prevailed among Kyiv residents regarding Russia's commitment to peace, and Ukrainian officials expressed strong opposition to any peace plan that would recognize Russia's territorial claims. Additionally, weather conditions benefited Russian military operations, enabling infiltration tactics against Ukrainian defenses.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that on 24 October, the Russia-Ukraine war continued its escalatory trend with key developments in military and energy strategies. Russia aimed to enhance crude oil exports to China through various routes, with Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak emphasizing the possibility of extending agreements to 2033. Concurrently, media speculation about potential peace negotiations fueled fluctuations in oil prices and indicated the complexities of achieving stability in the region. The situation in Venezuela grew more precarious as indications of U.S. military readiness emerged, including the cancellation of leaves for personnel and increased preparations for possible strikes. Furthermore, a volcanic eruption in northern Ethiopia affected air travel in India, prompting flight cancellations and concerns about volcanic ash impacting aviation safety.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments in the Middle East. In the Gaza Strip, severe winter rains further exacerbated conditions for displaced families, as many experienced flooding in their makeshift tents. Israel's military conducted a large-scale exercise in the occupied Golan Heights in response to regional tensions following the assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander. In response to ongoing violence, the UN called for an investigation into Israeli strikes that resulted in civilian casualties in Lebanon, while Hamas warned that continued Israeli attacks could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire established a month prior. Following the deadly Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, Israel's military dismissed several generals and reprimanded other senior officials for their failure to prevent the incident. Additionally, the Trump administration initiated a review to designate branches of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations, aligning with concerns over regional instability. In a separate incident, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation announced its closure after over 2,000 Palestinians died seeking aid.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant geopolitical and humanitarian challenges in Nigeria, marked by a rising hunger crisis affecting nearly 35 million people due to armed attacks and aid cuts, as reported by the World Food Program on 25 November. The situation prompted authorities in Nigeria's Bauchi state to shut down schools in response to renewed jihadist kidnappings by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). Meanwhile, South Africa faced security issues relating to theft at the G20 summit, with over a dozen arrests reported. Additionally, a ceasefire plan in Sudan received calls for acceptance from U.S. envoy Massad Boulos, highlighting ongoing conflicts in the region. In military sports developments, Wales prepared to face South Africa despite missing key players, while reports emerged of India's Nitish Kumar Reddy making a limited contribution in the second Test match against South Africa.</li>
