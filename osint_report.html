        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States intensified its military engagement with Venezuela by pursuing a third sanctioned oil tanker in the Caribbean Sea. This development followed the seizure of a second oil tanker as part of President Donald Trump's blockade aimed at crippling Venezuela's vital oil industry. U.S. Coast Guard officials confirmed the active pursuit as part of Washington's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuelan officials condemned these actions, labeling them as "theft" and "hijacking," and pledged to bring their grievances to the United Nations. Tensions continued to escalate with accusations of piracy arising from the U.S. tactics, while economic implications saw oil prices fluctuate amid concerns over supply disruptions. Lawmakers, including some from Trump's own party, expressed concerns that these maritime confrontations could be seen as provocations potentially leading to war.
