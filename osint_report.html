A Russian drone strike in Kyiv killed one person, while Ukrainian military actions targeted Russian merchant vessels, amid ongoing violence and a governmental reshuffle in Ukraine to address corruption. Turkey reported potential threats to Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea as geopolitical instability continued, with President Putin rejecting peace proposals. In the Middle East, tensions flared following Israeli drone strikes in Gaza and military actions in the West Bank, prompting international condemnation.

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant escalations in U.S.-Venezuela tensions following U.S. President Donald Trump's declaration that airspace above and surrounding Venezuela should be considered closed in its entirety. This announcement came on 29 November amid increasing allegations of drug trafficking associated with the Venezuelan government, led by President Nicolás Maduro. Trump called upon all air carriers to acknowledge this closure, which coincided with a substantial military build-up by U.S. forces in the Caribbean, aimed at countering drug smuggling. Simultaneously, Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon conduct military actions targeting drug trafficking networks on Venezuelan land. In a related development, Trump intervened in Honduran politics by pardoning former President Juan Orlando Hernández, just days before the country's elections, raising concerns about U.S. influence in the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a Russian drone strike on Kyiv residential areas early on 24 October resulted in one death and seven injuries. The Ukrainian military reported that underwater drones targeted two Russian tankers in the Black Sea, contributing to a broader naval operation focused on disrupting Russia's shipping routes. Amidst escalating violence, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, amid a corruption scandal, appointing Rustem Umerov in his place as head of the negotiation delegation. This reshuffle coincided with heightened U.S.-led peace talks, although recent Russian missile and drone attacks killed at least two civilians in Kyiv, casting a shadow over ongoing diplomatic efforts. Additionally, Russian authorities launched a significant strike against Ukrainian military-industrial facilities in response to Ukrainian attacks, while reports emerged of airspace violations by Russian drones over Moldova and Romania. The geopolitical landscape remains tense as Ukraine navigates military confrontations while engaging in complex negotiations for peace.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Turkish Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu announced that two oil tankers associated with Russia’s “shadow fleet” potentially faced attacks from mines, missiles, or drones in the Black Sea. Additionally, geopolitical tensions escalated as Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected a proposed peace plan, contributing to ongoing instability in the region. The new prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Godwin Friday of the New Democratic Party, took office after defeating long-term leader Ralph Gonsalves. This transition, which resulted in Friday winning 14 out of 15 parliamentary seats, reflected a strong public demand for change. The ongoing war in Ukraine reached its 1,373rd day, highlighting the protracted nature of the conflict.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated Pope Leo XIV's visit to Lebanon underscored the challenges faced by Christian communities in northern Lebanon, while southern border villages struggled with post-war rebuilding after the Israel conflict. The Pope also completed his second day in Turkey, visiting Istanbul's Blue Mosque before engaging in discussions with religious leaders. In Gaza, Israeli drone attacks resulted in the deaths of two children, despite a declared ceasefire, and Israeli raids in the West Bank notably injured hundreds of Palestinians. Syria condemned the Israeli military's recent incursions, labeling them as war crimes after multiple casualties were reported. Additionally, Hezbollah's leaders responded to the assassination of a senior commander, hinting at potential retaliation, amidst rising tensions along the Israel-Syria border. Meanwhile, Iran criticized Israel's actions against Palestinians in the West Bank, calling for international accountability.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments across several geopolitical spheres. In Botswana, economic turmoil emerged as the nation, once thriving due to its diamond industry, faced unprecedented challenges. In Nigeria, an Anglican priest tragically died in captivity amid a surge in mass kidnappings, prompting security concerns and governmental measures to address escalating violence against Christians. In Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump ordered punitive measures against South Africa, freezing aid and excluding it from the upcoming 2026 G20 Summit, citing allegations of "white genocide." Additionally, the Nigerian president declared a nationwide security emergency following repeated attacks on Christian communities. In a separate issue, the United States facilitated a meeting between the heads of state of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, aimed at signing a peace agreement. These incidents underscore the ongoing instability and evolving geopolitical dynamics in Africa and beyond.</li>
