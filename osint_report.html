    <p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, President Donald Trump announced a U.S. military strike on a facility in Venezuela linked to drug trafficking, marking a significant escalation in U.S. military actions and potentially impacting geopolitical dynamics in the region favorably to Russia. In Ukraine, President Zelenskyy refuted Russian claims of a drone attack on Putin’s residence, yet tensions remained high as Russian shelling continued and no concrete peace progress was evident despite U.S. proposals. China conducted military drills around Taiwan as a warning against external influences, coinciding with rising U.S. arms support for Taiwan. In Gaza, Netanyahu and Trump discussed advancing a ceasefire amidst ongoing clashes and deteriorating humanitarian conditions. In Africa, Nigeria hinted at further joint military operations with the U.S. against jihadists following an airstrike, as regional foreign ministers addressed security concerns tied to Israel's recent endorsement of Somaliland's independence.</p>

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump announced that U.S. forces conducted a military strike on a facility in Venezuela, which he linked to alleged drug trafficking operations. This remark, made during a radio interview on 24 December, marked a significant escalation in U.S. military actions in the region and potentially represented the first land strike against Venezuela since military operations commenced in September. Analysts suggested that this action might align with broader geopolitical shifts, as Trump's interventions in Venezuela were perceived to strengthen Russia's influence in the region amid a contemporary multipolar world. Additionally, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro criticized U.S. military actions as unjust and warned against the implications of foreign intervention.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukraine denied allegations from Russia claiming a drone attack targeted President Vladimir Putin's residence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed these accusations as "typical Russian lies." Despite displays of optimism by both Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Florida, there remained little evidence of tangible progress towards peace between Ukraine and Russia. Zelenskyy announced that the United States proposed a 15-year security guarantee as part of a peace plan. Concurrently, Russian forces shelled the Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. Following recent talks, Kremlin officials acknowledged Trump's assertions regarding the peace process’s potential advancement, although Russia's foreign minister indicated that the alleged drone attack might alter their negotiating position.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China conducted significant military drills around Taiwan, which Beijing characterized as a "stern warning" against "external forces." On 25 December, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) initiated "Justice Mission 2025," involving joint air, navy, and rocket troops performing live-fire exercises designed to simulate a blockade of Taiwan's major ports. These actions were prompted by rising tensions following notable U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and remarks from Japan's Prime Minister that suggested potential military involvement should China aggress against Taiwan. Observers noted that Taiwan condemned these drills as military intimidation and raised its own defenses amid the upcoming military activities, which spanned from 25 to 26 December, imposing restrictions in specific sea and air zones around the island.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former President Donald Trump met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on 29 December, focusing on advancing a fragile ceasefire in Gaza and discussing broader regional issues, including Iran. Despite the ongoing talks, clashes between the Israel Defense Forces and Gaza militants continued, highlighting tensions on the ground. Israel's military actions in Palestine, Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Qatar, and Yemen sparked concern about the effectiveness of diplomatic efforts. Additionally, heavy winter rains exacerbated conditions in Gaza, flooding displacement camps and complicating humanitarian efforts, as Israel limited aid access. Iran experienced widespread protests due to its deteriorating economic situation, further destabilizing the region.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Nigeria, Egypt, and Algeria qualified for the Round of 16 in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), with various teams vying for the remaining knockout spots. Notably, the match between Angola and Egypt featured prominent players, including Mohamed Salah, who started on the bench. In Nigeria, former heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua sustained minor injuries in a car crash that resulted in two fatalities, highlighting safety concerns on the Lagos–Abeokuta Expressway, a major route in the region. Moreover, Nigeria signaled the likelihood of additional joint military operations with the United States against jihadist groups following a Christmas Day airstrike in Sokoto. Additionally, a joint statement was issued by multiple Middle Eastern and African foreign ministers, addressing regional cooperation and security concerns, particularly in light of Israel's recent endorsement of Somaliland's independence, which drew condemnation from African leaders.</li>
