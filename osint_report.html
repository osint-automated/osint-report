        <li><b>Venezuela:</b> During the reporting period, U.S. military operations in the Caribbean intensified as American forces targeted boats they claimed were transporting drugs from Venezuela. The U.S. conducted strikes on four vessels, resulting in at least 14 casualties in the Pacific Ocean. The deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, signaled a significant military presence aimed at pressuring the Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro. Amid these tensions, Venezuelan oil tankers continued to export oil, with Chevron holding a rare license that allowed it to extract up to one-third of the country's oil resources. Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister supported U.S. strikes against alleged Venezuelan traffickers, which led to retaliatory actions including the cessation of gas deals with Venezuela. Critics, including former Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, accused Maduro of transforming Venezuela into a "narco-state," while the Iranian Foreign Ministry warned that U.S. military actions posed threats to peace in the Caribbean and Latin America.</li>

Concurrently, Lithuania announced a one-month closure of its border with Belarus following an intrusion involving smuggled goods. In a strategic shift, the United States confirmed a reduction of its troop presence in Romania, maintaining approximately 1,000 soldiers amid concerns about a potential security vacuum in Eastern Europe.

        <li><b>China:</b> During the reporting period, Nvidia became the world's first company to achieve a market capitalization of $5 trillion on 25 October, marking a significant milestone just months after reaching $4 trillion. President Donald Trump expressed confidence in securing a trade agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their meeting at the APEC summit in Busan, South Korea. As part of the ongoing trade dynamics, China's state-owned company COFCO purchased three U.S. soybean cargoes this week, signaling a potential shift in economic relations. Additionally, Trump's administration suggested possible tariff reductions on Chinese goods, further setting the stage for negotiations. Meanwhile, military actions continued with the U.S. military destroying drug trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela, complicating geopolitical tensions in the region while concerns over China’s influence persisted.</li>

        <li><b>Israel:</b> During the reporting period, military and geopolitical tensions escalated significantly in Gaza, Palestine, following renewed Israeli airstrikes that killed over 100 Palestinians, including at least 35 children. These strikes occurred less than three weeks after a ceasefire was announced on 10 October and prompted accusations from both sides of violating the truce. Israeli officials blamed Hamas for attacking troops and failing to return deceased hostages, while Hamas condemned Israel's aggressive operations. Concurrently, US President Donald Trump maintained that the ceasefire remains intact despite the violence. In Jamaica, Hurricane Melissa struck as a Category 5 storm, causing extensive devastation and leading to operational disruptions at airports amid a government shutdown affecting air traffic controllers. Additionally, negotiations continued between Syria and Israel, reportedly nearing completion on a security agreement that would involve joint presence from the US, Israel, and Syria, reflecting ongoing geopolitical complexities in the region.</li>

Meanwhile, North Korea conducted cruise missile tests in the Yellow Sea, which it characterized as a demonstration of military prowess, coinciding with Trump's arrival. Although Trump expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, logistical challenges prevented such a meeting, leading to speculation surrounding the dynamics of U.S.-North Korea relations. South Korea honored Trump with its highest award, the "Grand Order of Mugunghwa," and a golden crown, signifying the nation’s commitment to strengthening bilateral ties amidst ongoing military tensions with the North.</li>
