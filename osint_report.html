        Khamenei. South Sudan's political turmoil threatened the Revitalized Peace Agreement, heightening the risk of
        mass atrocities, while Nigeria and Cameroon advanced aviation safety cooperation. Overall, these developments
        underscored a dynamic and precarious security landscape across multiple regions.</p>
    <ul>

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the killing of notorious
            drug kingpin Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes occurred on 24 October during a precision military raid
            in Jalisco, Mexico. This operation sparked retaliatory violence in Mexico, predominantly involving
            American-made firearms. Following El Mencho’s death, concerns arose regarding the impact on tourism in
            Mexico, particularly in popular destinations like Puerto Vallarta, where Canadian airline regulators
            announced an investigation into recent flight disruptions. Reports highlighted that El Mencho maintained
            detailed records of bribes paid to local, state, and federal law enforcement, demonstrating extensive
            corruption. As the situation unfolded, discussions among bishops from the Texas-Mexico border addressed
            their pastoral roles amid the escalating violence. The ongoing influence of El Mencho's cartel in the United
            States persisted, raising alerts about narcotics trafficking continuity despite his removal.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and
            geopolitical developments impacting global security dynamics. NATO officials acknowledged Ukraine's ongoing
            war revealed the urgent need for improvements in the West's weapons production capabilities. Concurrently,
            diplomatic tensions escalated as world leaders expressed concerns over the U.S.-Israeli
            strikes on Iran, with several nations calling for restraint to prevent broader conflicts, especially in the
            Middle East. Russia condemned these actions as unprovoked aggression, warning of potential catastrophes
            stemming from the escalation. In Europe, Denmark's intelligence services revealed risks of foreign
            interference in its upcoming general election, primarily citing Russian threats. Furthermore, the situation
            in Ukraine continued to deteriorate, with reports of ongoing Russian operations in the Kharkov and
            Dnepropetrovsk regions and civilians increasingly suffering from the war's ramifications in Kyiv.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a Chinese military
            spokesperson criticized the Philippines for allegedly disrupting peace and stability in the South China Sea
            by involving external countries in joint patrols. On 24 February,
            combined forces from Japan, the Philippines, and the United States engaged in a Multilateral Maritime
            Cooperative Activity in the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone, reinforcing their commitment to regional
            security. A U.S. think tank recommended that Taiwan adopt a "hellscape" strategy involving a significant
            drone presence in the Taiwan Strait to deter potential Chinese aggression.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, the United States and Israel conducted sustained joint
            airstrikes under Operations Epic Fury and Roaring Lion against Iranian nuclear infrastructure, ballistic
            missile production facilities, IRGC command centers, air defense networks, and senior leadership sites,
            confirming the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei along with multiple high-ranking military
            officials including Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammad Pakpour and security adviser Ali Shamkhani, and
            causing over 200 fatalities in Iran per Red Crescent reports, including significant civilian losses from a
            strike on a girls' elementary school in Minab that killed at least 148 children. Iran retaliated with
            successive barrages of ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli population centers—resulting in at
            least nine civilian deaths in Beit Shemesh and over 120 injuries across Jerusalem and Tel Aviv areas—and
            U.S. military installations throughout the Gulf region, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Al Dhafra in
            the UAE, Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, and facilities in Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia,
            supplemented by proxy drone strikes and maritime attacks near the Strait of Hormuz. U.S. Central Command
            assessed minimal damage to bases from successful intercepts with no operational disruptions, but confirmed
            three American service members killed in action and five seriously wounded during the overall campaign,
            alongside minor shrapnel injuries and concussions among others returning to duty; no additional American
            fatalities occurred from direct Iranian retaliatory strikes on regional bases.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and
            geopolitical developments. The United Nations cited that South Sudan's political and military
            leaders have taken actions undermining the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement, raising concerns over potential
            mass atrocities and renewed conflict. Tensions escalated as the UN Human Rights Council debated the
            deteriorating situation, amidst a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the conflict in neighboring Sudan.
            Meanwhile, on the same day, Nigeria and Cameroon signed a new aviation safety agreement to enhance
            coordination for search and rescue operations in their shared airspace. Additionally, South African
            President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the deployment of military personnel in high-crime areas to assist
            police forces amid concerns over public safety. These developments highlight an interconnected landscape of
            military readiness and evolving geopolitics across multiple regions.</li>
