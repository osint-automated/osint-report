        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia formally requested the United States to cease pursuit of the oil tanker Bella 1, which had been attempting to reach Venezuela while evading U.S. military forces. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro expressed a willingness to engage in serious discussions with the U.S. regarding drug trafficking and potential oil investments, though he avoided commenting on recent U.S. military strikes targeting Venezuelan docking areas allegedly linked to drug cartels. Maduro characterized the possibility of negotiations as open to U.S. involvement "wherever they want and whenever they want," while the U.S. military confirmed recent operations that eliminated several drug trafficking vessels in the region. The geopolitical tension between the U.S. and Venezuela continued to escalate, particularly against the backdrop of broader U.S. interventionist themes in Latin America and the Caribbean.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the British military anticipated an increase in the deployment of high-end Russian military equipment, such as T-14 tanks and Su-57 fighter jets, in Ukraine, though such equipment had not yet been observed in combat. Russian authorities reported that a Ukrainian drone strike on a café in the Russian-occupied Kherson Region resulted in 27 casualties, an assertion that Kyiv rejected, maintaining that its military actions targeted only military sites. The US military engaged with the oil tanker Bella 1 in the Caribbean, which Russia had previously sought to prevent the US from boarding as it headed to Venezuela. Finnish officials arrested two crew members of a cargo ship tied to damage inflicted on an undersea telecommunications cable in the Gulf of Finland. Notably, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appointed military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov as his top aide, who has been recognized for conducting effective operations against Russian forces. The situation in Ukraine remained tense, with drone strikes continuing to escalate between the two countries, raising concerns about further civilian casualties and potential repercussions for peace negotiations.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Taiwan maintained a high alert status on 1 January 2026, as Chinese naval maneuvers around the island followed extensive military drills. The Taiwanese coast guard operated its emergency maritime response center in response to these developments. Additionally, on the same day, the US Navy successfully rescued three distressed Filipino fishermen in the South China Sea while the USNS Cesar Chavez (T-AKE 14) was in transit. In military advancements, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy commissioned a new Type 052D guided missile destroyer named Loudi, enhancing its combat capabilities with upgraded radar and weapon systems. Amidst these tensions, Asia's geopolitical landscape showed signs of instability, with leaders acknowledging a potential decrease in US security commitments and analysts highlighting a growing sense of isolation among democratic nations in the region.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. U.S. President Donald Trump issued warnings to Iran regarding the violent suppression of ongoing protests, asserting that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" to intervene should Iranian authorities harm demonstrators. Meanwhile, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) targeted Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, citing breaches of ceasefire agreements. In Gaza, a tragic incident resulted in the death of a grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson due to a fire while cooking. Furthermore, reports surfaced that over 1,800 United Nations peacekeepers withdrew from southern Lebanon as part of a larger drawdown. In Turkey, approximately 500,000 individuals participated in an anti-Israel rally, indicating growing regional tensions. Additionally, Iranian officials announced that the country would accept cryptocurrency for advanced weapons purchases, further complicating the geopolitical landscape.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Mali and Burkina Faso responded to U.S. travel restrictions by imposing reciprocal bans on American citizens, effective from 1 January. In the Central African Republic, President Faustin-Archange Touadera faced a test of stability following relatively peaceful elections held on 28 December. Meanwhile, Sudan experienced a humanitarian crisis in el-Fasher after a takeover by the Rapid Support Forces, leading to warnings of mass deaths as UN officials visited the area. In regional developments, the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN 2025) progressed with notable surprises, including Sudan qualifying for the knockout stage without scoring a goal and Mozambique's president promising monetary bonuses for defeating Nigeria in the upcoming matches. Additionally, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) convened an extraordinary meeting to address the ongoing situation in Somalia.</li>
