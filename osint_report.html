        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. military operations in the Caribbean heightened tensions with Venezuela as President Donald Trump intensified pressure on Nicolás Maduro's regime. On 2 September, the U.S. military executed an airstrike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel, which resulted in casualties among individuals listed as military targets by the U.S. Navy. Following this, both U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials defended the military's actions against what they termed drug trafficking threats, despite calls for an inquiry into potential war crimes. Concurrently, the U.S. State Department reaffirmed its Level 4 travel advisory for Venezuela, cautioning against travel due to rampant violent crime and health risks. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey urged both the U.S. and Venezuela to maintain open dialogue amid rising fears of U.S. military engagement. Meanwhile, supporters of Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado rallied globally in response to her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, showcasing international solidarity against the Maduro government amidst escalating geopolitical strife in the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in the ongoing military and geopolitical landscape surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On 3 December, officials in Ukraine reported that a Russian overnight attack targeted the industrial city of Kremenchuk, leading to casualties among the local infrastructure. Additionally, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy faced increasing pressure following a difficult negotiation with U.S. representatives to discuss a proposed peace plan authored by the United States, which he indicated he was not ready to endorse. In a separate incident, Zelenskyy narrowly escaped a suspected drone attack near Dublin Airport, attributed to hybrid warfare tactics. Meanwhile, U.S. officials described the potential for a peace deal as being "really close," although the Kremlin demanded major alterations to the proposals. Internationally, concerns arose as European leaders speculated that U.S. support for Ukraine might diminish under a potential Trump administration, affecting the country's ability to confront ongoing Russian aggression.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated heightened military tensions between China and Japan, highlighted by multiple incidents where Chinese fighter jets directed fire-control radar at Japanese aircraft near the Okinawa Islands. Japan's Defense Ministry characterized this behavior as dangerous and launched formal protests against China for these confrontations over international waters. Concurrently, China deployed its largest naval presence yet in East Asian waters, coinciding with Japan's increased militarization of the Ryukyu island chain amidst ongoing concerns over Taiwan. Additionally, the geopolitical landscape evolved as the United States, the European Union, and Saudi Arabia revived the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), a strategic initiative aimed at countering China's influence and pulling India closer to the West. In this context, Chinese officials maintained that their naval training operations did not target any specific countries, despite increased scrutiny and escalating tensions in the region.</li>

Meanwhile, Iran conducted military drills in the Persian Gulf, showcasing advanced missile technology, while Hezbollah's Secretary-General warned of Israeli aggression in Lebanon.

A drone strike attributed to the Rapid Support Forces and allied groups resulted in over 100 deaths at a preschool in Sudan.

The Economic Community of West African States condemned the coup attempt, threatening to deploy a standby force to restore order. Additionally, Nigeria's government expressed solidarity with Benin and condemned the coup attempt, emphasizing the importance of regional stability.
