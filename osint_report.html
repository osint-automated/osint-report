        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela could significantly alter global oil markets. On 10 December, U.S. forces conducted a high-stakes operation to seize a Venezuelan oil tanker, an act that Caracas condemned as piracy and theft, asserting that it underscored U.S. ambitions to control Venezuela's vast oil and mineral resources. This action marked a notable shift in U.S. engagement, moving from traditional drug interdiction to direct economic warfare, with the Trump administration justifying its military posture by labeling Venezuela a national security threat. Analysts speculated that the U.S. military buildup in the region could aim for regime change not only in Venezuela but potentially in Cuba as well. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government criticized the European Union for freezing Russian assets as an illegal act of expropriation.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed readiness to abandon Ukraine's NATO membership ambitions in exchange for security guarantees from Western allies during talks in Berlin on 24 October. Zelenskyy's negotiations involved U.S. envoys including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who arrived in Germany to discuss terms aimed at curbing the ongoing conflict with Russia. The Kremlin claimed that NATO specialists' presence in Ukraine catalyzed Russia's military operations, while Western officials expressed alarm over undisclosed meetings between Ukrainian negotiators and the FBI. Concurrently, Russian forces reported the liberation of Varvarovka in Zaporozhye, amidst ongoing military actions, including Ukraine's drone attacks against Russian oil platforms and refineries. The U.S. Congress approved an $800 million military aid package for Ukraine, reflecting ongoing support despite rising corruption concerns. Meanwhile, Russian officials accused Ukraine of planning a “dirty bomb” operation, dismissing the allegations as disinformation.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that on 24 October, the Philippine coastguard reported injuries to fishermen and damage to their boat during a skirmish involving the Chinese coastguard. The Philippine vessels dispatched to assist the injured were reportedly obstructed multiple times. Meanwhile, Ukraine escalated its energy conflict by executing an unprecedented drone strike on Russia’s Vladimir Filanovsky oil platform in the Caspian Sea, disrupting 120,000 barrels per day of oil production, which accounts for 8% of Lukoil’s output. In related geopolitical developments, a retired Lieutenant General from India highlighted the likelihood of 'Operation Sindoor 2.0,' driven by Pakistan's persistent focus on Kashmir, supported by China and Türkiye. Lastly, US special forces conducted a raid on a cargo ship in November traveling from China to Iran, seizing technology deemed dual-use military items.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that armed Palestinians killed a Hamas security officer in the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, with a suspect reportedly arrested. Israeli forces killed senior Hamas commander Raed Saad in Gaza on 21 October, amidst ongoing tensions surrounding the fragile ceasefire, which has seen over 300 Palestinians die due to Israeli attacks since it began. Following an ambush by alleged Islamic State militants near Palmyra in central Syria, three Americans, including two U.S. soldiers, were killed, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to promise retaliation. In response to the June 2024 mass shooting during a Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australian authorities are treating the incident as an act of antisemitism and terror. Meanwhile, Türkiye condemned the attack on the U.S.-Syrian patrol and affirmed its commitment to stabilizing Syria. Israel announced plans to fund the clearing of rubble in Gaza, a region assessed to require $70 billion for reconstruction following extensive conflict-damage.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the Nigerian military faced prolonged detention in Burkina Faso, with diplomatic efforts ongoing for their release after six days in custody. In Sudan, six Bangladesh peacekeepers died following a drone strike attributed to ongoing conflicts in the Kordofan region. The United Nations condemned the attack, suggesting it could amount to war crimes. Myanmar's military regime called on nations to repatriate detained citizens amid a crackdown on scam operations. In West Africa, ECOWAS leaders, including Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, convened in Abuja to discuss regional security and address recent coup attempts in members states. Furthermore, reports from Mali noted allegations of sexual assaults committed against women and girls by Russian paramilitary forces, highlighting the ongoing conflict's humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, Nigeria's 2025 World Malaria Report revealed it has the highest malaria burden globally, with 68 million cases and 184,000 deaths projected for 2024.</li>
