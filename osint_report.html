        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. military activities in the Caribbean intensified as President Donald Trump ordered a "total and complete blockade" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. This action escalated tensions with the Venezuelan government, prompting Caracas to label the blockade as colonialist and interventionist. The blockade came shortly after the U.S. military seized a tanker off the Venezuelan coast, and amid discussions regarding a military build-up in Trinidad and Tobago for improved logistics and operational capabilities against Venezuela. Trump’s administration aimed to pressure the Nicolás Maduro regime further, while Venezuelan officials accused the U.S. of having ulterior motives to appropriate their natural resources. Additionally, the U.N. warned about escalating human rights violations in Venezuela amid increased militarization.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukrainian forces faced increasing challenges in casualty evacuations due to a surge in drone activity on the battlefield. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow would seek to extend its territorial gains in Ukraine if peace talks with Kyiv and its Western allies did not yield favorable outcomes. The Kremlin also signaled a willingness to discuss the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine, despite prior opposition to such moves. In response to potential threats, U.S. officials prepared new sanctions against Russia, focusing on vessels linked to its oil industry. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones continued to target Russian energy infrastructure, with strikes reported on an oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai and other strategic locations. Additionally, NATO's pledge to increase defense spending was highlighted as a significant achievement of former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The escalating military and geopolitical tensions prompted calls from EU leaders for more concerted action regarding the use of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's defense efforts.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump ordered a blockade on 16 December of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, intensifying U.S. pressure on Nicolás Maduro's government. Meanwhile, a fleet of tankers carrying Russian Urals oil had amassed off China's east coast, after India reduced its purchases due to Western sanctions. Additionally, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine expressed cautious optimism regarding future security guarantees, amid ongoing tensions with Russia, which consistently rejected diplomatic overtures. Furthermore, significant progress occurred in the discovery of a large critical minerals deposit in Utah, described by Ionic Minerals Technology as one of North America's most significant finds.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) conducted operations in southern Lebanon, killing at least three individuals during drone strikes on 14 December. The strikes targeted vehicles allegedly belonging to Hezbollah, amid rising tensions as the militant group faced a disarmament deadline. Concurrently, the IDF maintained its deployment along the Yellow Line in accordance with a ceasefire agreement, engaging in two separate incidents against perceived threats from Hezbollah. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsened, as heavy winter storms exacerbated conditions, leading to building collapses and fatalities, including the death of a two-week-old infant due to hypothermia linked to limited resources amid ongoing conflict. In international developments, the Trump administration expanded travel restrictions, now including an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, significantly increasing the scope of its travel ban.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the Trump administration expanded travel restrictions to include an additional 20 countries, effectively doubling the number of nations affected by these bans. On 24 October, the administration imposed a full entry ban on citizens from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority, citing security concerns, visa issues, and corruption. This action raised the total number of restricted countries to 39, which included notable nations like Nigeria, a significant source of international students for U.S. colleges. Additionally, the U.S. government faced criticism for its immigration policies, particularly the rhetoric that could be perceived as an invitation for military intervention in nations grappling with internal crises, such as Nigeria. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, M23 rebels advanced, seizing the strategic border town of Uvira amidst ongoing conflicts despite a recent peace deal, and Nigeria's football federation lodged complaints with FIFA regarding player eligibility irregularities involving DR Congo in the World Cup qualifiers.</li>
