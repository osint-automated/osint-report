        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the killing of notorious drug kingpin Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes occurred on 24 October during a precision military raid in Jalisco, Mexico. This operation sparked retaliatory violence in Mexico, predominantly involving American-made firearms. Following El Mencho’s death, concerns arose regarding the impact on tourism in Mexico, particularly in popular destinations like Puerto Vallarta, where Canadian airline regulators announced an investigation into recent flight disruptions. Reports highlighted that El Mencho maintained detailed records of bribes paid to local, state, and federal law enforcement, demonstrating extensive corruption. As the situation unfolded, discussions among bishops from the Texas-Mexico border addressed their pastoral roles amid the escalating violence. The ongoing influence of El Mencho's cartel in the United States persisted, raising alerts about narcotics trafficking continuity despite his removal.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments impacting global security dynamics. NATO officials acknowledged Ukraine's ongoing war revealed the urgent need for improvements in the West's weapons production capabilities. In a related operational move, the U.S. military deployed a new task force utilizing cost-effective drone technology to conduct strikes against Iran, marking a shift toward affordable drone capabilities to combat adversaries. Concurrently, diplomatic tensions escalated as world leaders expressed concerns over the U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran, with several nations calling for restraint to prevent broader conflicts, especially in the Middle East. Russia condemned these actions as unprovoked aggression, warning of potential catastrophes stemming from the escalation. In Europe, Denmark's intelligence services revealed risks of foreign interference in its upcoming general election, primarily citing Russian threats. Furthermore, the situation in Ukraine continued to deteriorate, with reports of ongoing Russian operations in the Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk regions and civilians increasingly suffering from the war's ramifications in Kyiv.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a Chinese military spokesperson criticized the Philippines for allegedly disrupting peace and stability in the South China Sea by involving external countries in joint patrols. The U.S. conducted combat operations against Iran amid little public support, raising fears among allies about escalating tensions in the region. On 24 February, combined forces from Japan, the Philippines, and the United States engaged in a Multilateral Maritime Cooperative Activity in the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone, reinforcing their commitment to regional security. A U.S. think tank recommended that Taiwan adopt a "hellscape" strategy involving a significant drone presence in the Taiwan Strait to deter potential Chinese aggression. The Iranian Navy's 103rd flotilla returned to the southeastern port city of Konarak after a 100-day deployment. Concurrently, U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran prompted increased tanker caution in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil transit route, while OPEC+ considered a larger supply increase following these attacks. As the military and geopolitical landscape evolved, the potential for further conflict and its implications for global oil markets remained significant.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States and Israel launched significant military strikes against Iran, marking the beginning of what President Donald Trump termed a "major combat operation." Explosions were reported across various Iranian cities, including Tehran, as the strikes aimed at major military targets within the country. In response, global airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, canceled flights across the region due to safety concerns, leading to empty airspace over Iran. The Iranian government faced severe disruptions, including a near-total internet blackout affecting its approximately 93 million citizens. Reports surfaced of chaos within Tehran, with residents scrambling for safety as U.S. forces executed "Operation Epic Fury," which had been in planning for months. In retaliation, Iran reportedly launched missiles targeting U.S. military bases in the region. Additionally, eight countries, including Jordan and Qatar, closed their airspace, significantly affecting international travel routes.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. On 24 October, the United Nations cited that South Sudan's political and military leaders have taken actions undermining the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement, raising concerns over potential mass atrocities and renewed conflict. Tensions escalated as the UN Human Rights Council debated the deteriorating situation, amidst a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the conflict in neighboring Sudan. Meanwhile, on the same day, Nigeria and Cameroon signed a new aviation safety agreement to enhance coordination for search and rescue operations in their shared airspace. The U.S. military conducted airstrikes in Iran without Congressional approval, risking a broader regional conflict, which President Donald Trump justified as necessary for regime change. In a related note, Iran's Navy returned home after a 100-day international mission, reaffirming its commitment to national security. Additionally, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the deployment of military personnel in high-crime areas to assist police forces amid concerns over public safety. These developments highlight an interconnected landscape of military readiness and evolving geopolitics across multiple regions.</li>
