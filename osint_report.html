        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments concerning Venezuela. On 17 November, the Trump administration announced its intention to designate the Venezuela-based Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, amid increasing military tensions in the region. President Donald Trump confirmed he had not ruled out deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela and acknowledged the arrival of the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier in the Caribbean, enhancing U.S. military capabilities for potential strikes. Additionally, Trump expressed openness to direct talks with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, suggesting diplomatic channels while maintaining military options. Concurrently, in Texas, authorities conducted a raid associated with the Tren de Aragua gang, resulting in over 140 arrests linked to an illegal immigration operation.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Taiwan announced further tightening of its export controls on dual-use technology, focusing on items such as quantum computers and advanced materials, aiming to prevent illicit military applications. In Ukraine, key events during the ongoing conflict included an increase in Russian missile attacks, which resulted in the death of a teenager and injuries to nine others in Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Velizy-Villacoublay, France, to finalize a 'historic' agreement for the acquisition of 100 Rafale F4 fighter jets. Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk condemned an explosion on a railway line serving Ukraine as an act of sabotage. The EU faced challenges with defense readiness against potential Russian drone attacks, as noted by EU defense commissioner Andrius Kubilius. Furthermore, North Korea's incursions prompted South Korea to propose military talks, the first in seven years, to mitigate border tensions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a diplomatic dispute emerged between Japan and China following comments made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi regarding Taiwan, reflecting the fragile nature of their bilateral ties. On 17 November 2025, reports highlighted that historical grievances and ongoing territorial disputes further complicated this relationship. Meanwhile, expanding sanctions on Chinese ports and refiners hindered the flow of Russian and Iranian oil to China, the world's largest oil importer; however, emerging workarounds suggested that this slowdown might be temporary. Additionally, the US Treasury Department reported that sanctions targeting Russian companies Rosneft and Lukoil significantly reduced Russia's oil revenue, marking one of the strongest sanctions imposed since the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that displaced Palestinians in Gaza faced severe humanitarian conditions as aid agencies called for permission to establish more shelters due to imminent hazardous winter rains. The security situation escalated as the Israeli military reported the killing of a Hezbollah operative in southern Lebanon, a region that has seen sporadic violence despite an existing ceasefire. In Jordan, the parliament reinstated conscription for men, marking the end of a multi-decade absence of mandatory military service. In Iraq, the pro-Iran Coordination Framework declared a majority in parliament, positioning itself to nominate the next prime minister. The United Nations Security Council endorsed President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, establishing a framework for an international stabilization force and U.S.-Israeli oversight of future governance in the region, amid dissent from Hamas regarding the proposal's implications for sovereignty. Furthermore, President Trump announced the sale of F-35 stealth fighters to Saudi Arabia ahead of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington, raising concerns over regional military balances.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. In Mali, forces from the military and allied militias executed a massacre of at least 31 civilians and destroyed their homes in the central region, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution endorsing President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza, marking a noteworthy shift in U.S. diplomatic strategy. Concurrently, reports of increasing tensions between China and Japan emerged, driven by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments regarding Taiwan, which Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te described as severely undermining regional peace. Furthermore, South Africa expressed suspicion related to an Israeli national linked to the recent arrivals of Gazans, highlighting ongoing geopolitical complexities in the region.</li>
