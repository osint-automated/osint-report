        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a range of significant military and geopolitical developments. On 3 November, the United States and Israel accused Iran of orchestrating a plot to assassinate the Israeli ambassador to Mexico, alleging an escalation of tensions in the region. Meanwhile, in response to concerns over drug trafficking from Venezuela, a group of U.S. Senators sought to halt President Trump's military action against drug vessels associated with Hezbollah's reported plans to extend its operations in Venezuela. The situation in the Indo-Pacific also remained tense, with ongoing debates surrounding U.S. military presence amid escalating local conflicts. In the oil sector, predictions estimated that South America, driven by production from Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina, would remain a crucial player in non-OPEC+ oil supply leading up to 2030, reinforcing geopolitical interests in the area.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments stemming from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Large-scale Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure resulted in widespread power outages and casualties, with at least two reported deaths from the strikes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed over 300 Russian soldiers had entered the eastern city of Pokrovsk, intensifying the battle for territory, with Ukrainian forces deploying elite units to respond. In parallel, NATO chief Mark Rutte expressed confidence in the alliance's nuclear deterrence capabilities following recent drills, amidst rising tensions from US nuclear brinkmanship towards Russia. Additionally, the United States granted Hungary a one-year exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, a move that followed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's appeals for relief. The European Union responded to the ongoing conflict by tightening visa restrictions for Russian citizens.</li>
