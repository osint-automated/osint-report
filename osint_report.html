    <p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, critical military and geopolitical updates revealed a
        significant escalation in violence and instability across multiple regions. The United States and Israel jointly launch major coordinated
        strikes on Iran on 28 February, under Operation Epic Fury (U.S.) and Roaring Lion (Israel). In Mexico, cartel-related violence
        surged following the death of a cartel leader, prompting cruise lines to skip Puerto Vallarta and the escape of
        23 inmates from a prison, facilitated by cartel gunmen. Meanwhile, Ukraine demonstrated effective military
        operations by destroying enemy drones and received an $8.1 billion loan package from the International Monetary
        Fund for post-war recovery. Tensions heightened in the South China Sea, where Chinese military activity
        increased alongside joint exercises involving U.S., Philippine, and Japanese forces. In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes
        resulted in civilian casualties as international tensions over the Israel-Palestine conflict deepened, with
        growing American sympathy for Palestinians. Africa faced rising instability, with South Sudan on the brink of
        renewed conflict, significant jihadist violence in Burkina Faso, and escalating tensions in Ethiopia's Tigray
        region.</p>

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that several cruise lines
            opted to skip stops in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, following increased violence after the death of cartel
            leader Nemesio "El Mencho" Oseguera. This week, 23 inmates escaped from a prison in Puerto Vallarta, with
            cartel gunmen facilitating the break, highlighting the escalating chaos. The U.S. State Department replaced
            its "shelter in place" order for Americans in Mexico with a less severe "travel advisory." In related
            developments, the U.S. offered $10 million for information leading to the capture of Sinaloa cartel leaders
            in Tijuana and cartel bosses Rene and Alfonso Arzate Garcia. Meanwhile, FIFA President Gianni Infantino
            expressed confidence in Mexico as a host for the upcoming World Cup, despite acknowledging the ongoing
            violence. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed her commitment to hosting the event safely,
            responding to Infantino's reassurances.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukrainian helicopter crews
            effectively utilized machine guns to destroy eight Shahed and Gerbera drones in a single day, as confirmed
            by footage released by the Ukrainian navy on 24 October. The U.S. military shot down a Customs and Border
            Protection drone using a laser near El Paso, Texas, leading to the closure of nearby airspace, as confirmed
            by members of Congress. Russian forces gained control of the Krasnoznamenka settlement in the Dnepropetrovsk
            region, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The International Monetary Fund approved an $8.1 billion
            loan package for Ukraine, unlocking immediate access to $1.5 billion, aimed at assisting post-war recovery
            efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated readiness for peace talks with Russian President
            Vladimir Putin but maintained that Ukraine would not relinquish territory. Foreign casualties from the
            conflict included at least 55 confirmed deaths of Ghanaians, representing the highest toll from a single
            African nation. Additionally, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban requested EU assistance to investigate
            the condition of the damaged Druzhba oil pipeline.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China successfully retrieved
            the Long March 10 rocket booster from the South China Sea following a test flight on 16 February 2026.
            Concurrently, Chinese military drones conducted regular flights in the South China Sea while using false
            transponder signals to disguise their movements, potentially rehearsing for a future operation involving
            Taiwan. Philippine, U.S., and Japanese aircraft participated in joint military exercises over the Bashi
            Channel, which separates the Philippines from Taiwan, enhancing regional cooperation. In parallel, Taiwan
            reported the detection of eight aircraft and six vessels from the People's Liberation Army near its
            territory, with many sorties crossing into its air defense identification zone. Additionally, India
            announced plans to build a military airfield in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, aiming to counter China's
            growing influence in the region. As tensions escalated, Sweden also disrupted a suspected Russian drone near
            the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, participating in NATO exercises.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, the United States and Israel jointly launch major coordinated
            strikes on Iran on 28 February, under Operation Epic Fury (U.S.) and Roaring Lion (Israel), targeting
            Iranian nuclear facilities, ballistic missile infrastructure, military bases, and senior leadership
            compounds across cities including Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Karaj, and Kermanshah. Strikes hit the compound of
            Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, along with other high-value political and military figures, while
            aiming to degrade Iran's nuclear program and missile capabilities following failed indirect nuclear
            negotiations mediated by Oman. Iran immediately retaliates with waves of ballistic missiles and drones under
            "Truthful Promise 4," targeting Israeli territory and U.S. military installations throughout the Middle
            East, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE, Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, the
            U.S. Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, and sites in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Air defenses in Gulf states
            intercept many incoming projectiles, though explosions and at least one civilian fatality from debris occur;
            Iran declares all American and Israeli assets in the region legitimate targets, with ongoing missile and
            drone exchanges escalating regional tensions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that South Sudan faced an
            increased risk of returning to full-scale war as the UN warned of escalating atrocity risks and widespread
            impunity amid renewed fighting. In Burkina Faso, coordinated attacks by the Al-Qaeda affiliate JNIM resulted
            in over 130 deaths, highlighting the surge of jihadist violence across the Sahelian state. Tensions
            escalated in Ethiopia's Tigray region, where residents feared an imminent return to conflict as fragile calm
            persisted in Mekelle amid rising hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The US reported a historic low in
            citizens' support for Israel amid the ongoing Gaza conflict, with polls showing a shift in sympathy towards
            the Palestinian cause.</li>
