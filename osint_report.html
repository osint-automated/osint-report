Concurrently, tensions between the United States and Venezuela rose significantly, prompting the U.S. military to deploy various aircraft, including bombers and surveillance drones, along the Venezuelan coast. The U.S. government seized a Venezuelan oil tanker, escalating accusations of American military actions aimed at securing oil interests in the region.
