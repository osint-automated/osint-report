        <li><b>Venezuela:</b> During the reporting period, tensions escalated between the United States and Venezuela amidst significant military maneuvers. Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced that the Venezuelan military conducted exercises along its coast to protect against potential "covert operations" from the U.S., which has intensified its naval presence in the Caribbean. Since early September, the U.S. military engaged in multiple strikes against Venezuelan vessels alleged to be involved in drug trafficking, leading to considerable casualties. The deployment of the USS Gravely, a U.S. missile destroyer, to Trinidad and Tobago, about 10 kilometers from Venezuela's coast, heightened concerns in Caracas, prompting accusations from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that the U.S. was fabricating war tensions. Concurrently, discussions emerged about potential U.S. military actions against drug networks within Venezuela, indicating a possible shift towards more aggressive interventionist policies by the U.S. administration.</li>

Concurrently, Russian airstrikes on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of three individuals and injured 29 others, including six children, as part of ongoing hostilities in Ukraine.
