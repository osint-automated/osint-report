        <li><b>Venezuela:</b> During the reporting period, the United States intensified its military operations in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, executing strikes against boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking. On 29 October, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that U.S. forces killed four individuals on a boat, bringing the total fatalities in recent strikes to at least 62 since early September. The Pentagon labeled these operations as essential components of a war on drugs, although critics questioned the targeting and legality of these actions. Additionally, President Donald Trump deployed a Navy carrier strike group to the Caribbean, amid concerns that this build-up could signify an escalation against Venezuela. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro asserted that U.S. interventions represented provocations while claiming to have intercepted three drug-trafficking aircraft and neutralized camps involved in such activities. The geopolitical situation has created heightened tensions, with Maduro also proposing to revoke the nationality of Venezuelans supporting foreign intervention.</li>

Meanwhile, Polish MiG-29 jets intercepted a Russian spy plane flying over the Baltic Sea.

        <li><b>China:</b> During the reporting period, significant military and geopolitical developments emerged involving the United States and China. U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans on 30 October to resume nuclear weapons tests, marking the first such activity in 33 years, amid rising tensions with China and Russia. On the same day, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a face-to-face meeting in Busan, South Korea, where they agreed to a one-year trade truce. This agreement included a reduction of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly halving tariffs related to fentanyl, while China committed to suspending its controversial rare earth export controls for one year. Despite these negotiations, trade relations remained fraught, with both leaders acknowledging that significant disputes persisted, particularly over export restrictions and Taiwan. China additionally indicated plans to send astronauts to the moon by 2030, further emphasizing its ambitious space agenda amid competitive geopolitical dynamics.</li>

        <li><b>Israel:</b> During the reporting period, Israel continued its military operations in Gaza and Lebanon while geopolitical tensions escalated in the region. Israeli forces conducted a series of airstrikes in Gaza on 29 October, marking the deadliest night of bombing since the onset of a U.S.-brokered truce, resulting in over 100 Palestinian deaths, including many children. Concurrently, Israel executed incursions into southern Lebanon, prompting Lebanese President Joseph Aoun to instruct the Lebanese Army to confront Israeli actions. On the diplomatic front, Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for Turkey to leverage its influence on Hamas to stabilize the ceasefire in Gaza during his visit to Ankara. The U.N. International Court of Justice urged Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, which Israel has been restricting as it blocks longstanding aid organizations from operating in the area. In parallel, the United States, under President Trump, initiated discussions on resuming nuclear weapons testing, which raised concerns about global security implications.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Iran:</b> During the reporting period, the United States granted India a six-month exemption from sanctions related to its strategic Chabahar port project in Iran, allowing New Delhi to continue development and operations at this crucial facility. The Chabahar port serves as a key trade gateway for India to access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. President Donald Trump exerted pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt military operations in Gaza, emphasizing that prolonged conflict jeopardized U.S. diplomatic efforts in the region. The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the recent violence in Sudan's North Darfur region and decried Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, calling them violations of international law. Meanwhile, Iran reached an agreement with Afghanistan to resume discussions on shared water resources and prisoner exchanges, while also demanding the unconditional lifting of U.S. sanctions on Cuba at the United Nations.</li>

        <li><b>North Korea:</b> During the reporting period, President Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time since 1992, emphasizing the need for the United States to keep pace with similar programs in China and Russia. This directive came shortly before Trump's high-stakes summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, where the two leaders also discussed trade relations. In a significant shift in military policy, Trump announced that South Korea received U.S. approval to construct a nuclear-powered submarine, a decision aimed at strengthening Seoul's military capabilities amidst regional threats. These developments occurred against a backdrop of ongoing tensions in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with day 1,344 of the war highlighting continued military engagement and geopolitical complexities.</li>
