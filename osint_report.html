        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. military escalated its operations in Venezuela, confirming a drone strike on a dock perceived to be utilized by drug smugglers. This operation, attributed to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), marked one of the first direct U.S. attacks on Venezuelan soil, prompting concerns about increased military involvement in the region. Russian officials declared their support for Venezuela amid tensions with the U.S., as Moscow’s Foreign Minister held discussions with his Venezuelan counterpart regarding the situation. Additionally, the U.S. imposed new sanctions targeting Iranian entities linked to defense and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs, highlighting ongoing efforts to disrupt Iran's military partnerships, especially in connection with Venezuela. In light of these developments, analysts noted a potential response from both Iran and Venezuela to the U.S. actions, including claims of possible arms supplies from Iran to Venezuela.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russian helicopters remained cautious in their operations near Ukraine's naval drones, as they became easier targets. Russian authorities claimed that Ukraine attempted a drone strike on President Vladimir Putin's residence; however, the European Union's top diplomat deemed these claims unfounded. In his drive for a peace initiative, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump visit Ukraine, amid ongoing discussions regarding U.S. military deployment in support of Ukraine. Amidst rising tensions in Europe, Russia positioned hypersonic, nuclear-capable missiles in Belarus. Concurrently, Russian forces targeted energy facilities used by Ukraine's military-industrial complex and claimed the interception of drones over Moscow and the Crimean Peninsula. The Finnish authorities seized a vessel accused of damaging undersea telecommunications cables connecting Finland and Estonia, reflecting heightened concerns over infrastructure security in the Baltic Sea region. The geopolitical landscape remained complex as former Soviet republics condemned Ukraine's assertive military actions and questioned Western involvement in these events.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) successfully completed a series of military exercises in the waters off Taiwan, including live-fire drills and blockade simulations under the operation named “Justice Mission 2025.” The exercises included significant military assets such as missiles, fighter jets, and naval vessels. In response to international concerns regarding these drills, Beijing criticized foreign nations, including Japan, for what it deemed “extremely hypocritical” remarks. Meanwhile, Japan accelerated its military capabilities by doubling its annual arms spending in light of perceived threats from China. Taiwan remained on high alert throughout the Chinese maneuvers, condemning the exercises as a threat to regional security. After the drills concluded, Taiwan's coastguard reported the withdrawal of Chinese warships and coastguard vessels from the area.</li>

In Iran, protests erupted across multiple cities over economic hardships, leading to government crackdowns and the detainment of demonstrators. Meanwhile, Israel undertook thousands of attacks in Gaza in 2025, which extended to other countries in the region, deepening the humanitarian crisis. Israel moved to suspend operation licenses for numerous humanitarian organizations in Gaza, including Doctors Without Borders, citing alleged ties to Hamas, which raised concerns of catastrophic consequences for the Palestinian population. In Syria, leaked recordings suggested a plot by the Assad regime to destabilize the country with alleged Israeli support. Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of resuming ballistic missile production and nuclear program development, and suggested that Iran could supply arms to Venezuela. In a related note, Turkey arrested 125 suspects linked to ISIL amidst a growing crackdown on the group, reflecting rising concerns over its resurgence.</li>

In response to U.S. travel restrictions, both Mali and Burkina Faso imposed reciprocal travel bans on U.S. citizens, citing equivalency to measures previously enacted by the Trump administration. In sports news, Equatorial Guinea's Carlos Akapo and Josete Miranda received four-game bans for abusive conduct towards referees during the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2025 match against Sudan.
