        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a significant increase in military and geopolitical tensions in the Caribbean and Latin America. The United States intensified its military presence near Venezuela, conducting Operation Southern Spear, which involved sinking 20 suspected drug boats since September. President Donald Trump suggested he was close to deciding on military action against Venezuela, coinciding with the positioning of the USS Ford aircraft carrier in the region. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro criticized the U.S. exercises with Trinidad and Tobago as "irresponsible," while Latin American countries prepared potential responses to U.S. aggression. In Colombia, the government announced a $4.3 billion deal to procure Swedish fighter jets amidst escalating tensions with the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S. Marines engaged in a shootout with gang members in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, underscoring the volatile security situation in the region. The geopolitical landscape shifted as China sought to support Maduro's government, defying U.S. sanctions, thus reinforcing the complexities of international relations in America's backyard.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Finnish President Alexander Stubb warned a ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before spring 2026, urging European allies to maintain their support despite ongoing corruption scandals in Kyiv. On 14 November, a Russian missile barrage struck an apartment block in Kyiv, resulting in six fatalities, with President Volodymyr Zelensky condemning the attacks as acts of terror. Meanwhile, Russia increased its military pressure, launching its largest drone attack to date, employing 430 drones and 18 missiles against Ukraine. Ukrainian defenses intercepted a significant number of these threats, but the conflict continued to escalate with reports of Russian forces capturing two villages in the Zaporozhye region. The Kremlin's economy faced challenges as oil revenues decreased, prompting a shift to consumer taxation to address budget deficits. Additionally, discussions regarding prisoner exchanges resumed between Ukraine and Russia, with Zelensky stating they aimed to secure the return of approximately 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in military and geopolitical dynamics in Asia. A new defense pact between Japan and the Philippines, announced on 24 October, allowed the Japanese military to deploy to the Philippines for the first time since World War II, aiming to bolster regional security against China's advances. Concurrently, Chinese authorities urged the Philippines to cease provocative actions in the South China Sea, as tensions escalated following joint patrols between the Philippines, the United States, and Japan. China conducted a bomber formation patrol in the region, which it claims dominance over, further warning against the escalation of joint military exercises. Additionally, a China Coast Guard formation sailed through the Senkaku Islands, exacerbating tensions with Japan after comments from the Japanese Prime Minister regarding potential military responses to a Chinese attack on Taiwan. In this context, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to Taiwan by proposing a US$330 million arms sale, aimed at maintaining Taiwan's military readiness amid the shifting security landscape in the region.</li>
