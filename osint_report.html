        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.S. government did not acquire Venezuelan oil assets despite ongoing discussions about regime change in Venezuela that might open up its oil industry to foreign investment. President Donald Trump threatened ground military operations against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, amidst a military buildup in the Caribbean and increased U.S. airstrikes against boats in the region, which reportedly killed individuals tied to narcoterrorism. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, despite acknowledging the death of a detained opposition figure and feeling pressure from U.S. military actions, aimed to endure the current political climate. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions contributed to fluctuations in oil prices, influenced by expectations of an upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut and ongoing negotiations over the war in Ukraine. The administration's newly publicized National Security Strategy, termed the “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, designated a focus on preventing mass migration and addressed challenges posed by China’s advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics in the context of global power shifts.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with European allies, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German leader Friedrich Merz, in London on 6 December to discuss Ukraine's ongoing war with Russia. The talks followed stalled negotiations in the United States and demonstrated renewed European support for Ukraine amid increasing pressure from Washington for Kyiv to accept a revised peace deal. Additionally, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that a drone strike attributed to Russia damaged the protective shield of the Chernobyl reactor, creating a significant breach and raising concerns about radiation containment. Meanwhile, the UK Royal Navy introduced a new strategy to counter threats from Russia, incorporating experimental underwater drones to protect undersea infrastructure. The United States Congress considered a defense policy bill that proposed increasing funding for Ukraine, including a notable allocation of $400 million to assist in its conflict with Russia.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated escalating military tensions between Japan and China, marked by incidents involving Chinese fighter jets locking radar onto Japanese F-15s over international waters. Japan's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, condemned these actions and vowed a "calm and resolute" response, subsequently summoning China's ambassador to protest. In a related incident, the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) allegedly approached a Chinese aircraft carrier formation during a training exercise, prompting strong criticism from Chinese officials, who accused Japan of "slanderous actions." The geopolitical landscape in the Asia-Pacific region further intensified as Taiwan reported Chinese warships conducting military operations near its waters, raising security concerns for the region. Concurrently, the New Zealand Defence Force enhanced its enforcement of sanctions against North Korea, while the Pentagon endorsed the AUKUS pact, facilitating Australia's acquisition of nuclear submarines amid ongoing U.S.-China tensions. In an indication of strengthened ties, a Russian LNG facility delivered its first shipment to China since being sanctioned by the U.S., illustrating the deepening energy cooperation between Beijing and Moscow.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments across Syria, Israel, and Lebanon. One year after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, Syria saw nearly 1.8 million displaced individuals return home, although many remained uncertain about the fate of missing detainees. The ceasefire initiated on 10 October between Israel and Hamas largely held, despite reports of continued Israeli attacks in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that both parties would soon enter the second phase of the ceasefire discussions, focused on governance within Gaza. Meanwhile, tensions escalated in southern Yemen as UAE-backed separatists tightened their grip, leading to a brief closure of the country's airspace. In Lebanon, direct negotiations with Israel under a Five-Party Committee signaled a significant policy shift amid rising international pressures. Reports also surfaced concerning Hezbollah’s infiltration of the Lebanese army, raising concerns about its influence over public policy.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a series of significant military and geopolitical developments across Africa. On 24 October, Nigeria's President announced the deployment of troops and fighter jets to Benin to assist in quelling a coup attempt by mutinous soldiers. Subsequently, the armed forces of Benin successfully foiled the coup, leading President Talon to declare the situation under control and pledge severe punishment for the plotters. Concurrently, on 24 October, the Christian Association of Nigeria reported the release of 100 schoolchildren abducted from a Catholic school, although 165 individuals remained unaccounted for. In Sudan, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized control of the Heglig oil field, marking a significant blow to the national army and disrupting oil production. Furthermore, the World Food Programme highlighted that over six million people faced starvation in Sudan, amid ongoing violence that included drone strikes on civilian infrastructure, resulting in numerous casualties. These events collectively underscore the increasing instability and ongoing security challenges within the region.</li>
