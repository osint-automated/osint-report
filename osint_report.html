        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a significant escalation in military tensions between the United States and Venezuela. The U.S. launched a series of strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea, resulting in at least 80 casualties since September, and prompting Colombian President Gustavo Petro to suspend intelligence-sharing with the U.S., following a similar move by the United Kingdom. In response, Venezuela announced a "massive mobilization" of troops and weapons coinciding with the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group in the Caribbean. U.S. military officials presented President Donald Trump with various options for possible land-based strikes in Venezuela. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the legality of these military actions against accusations from allies, asserting that Europe should not dictate U.S. national security strategies. Amid these developments, there were discussions regarding Nicolás Maduro’s potential willingness to leave power in exchange for amnesty, amid ongoing protests in Puerto Rico against U.S. militarism.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the US Treasury Department identified two Ukrainian companies as fronts for Iranian agents supplying aerospace parts to HESA, the manufacturer of Iran's Shahed and Ababil military drones. A significant corruption scandal emerged in Ukraine, involving alleged $100 million kickbacks in energy contracts that implicated close associates of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Fighting intensified along the Ukraine-Russia front, with Kyiv claiming attacks on oil facilities in Zaporizhia and Crimea, while reports confirmed Russian advancements in southern Ukraine, resulting in the capture of three settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zelenskyy's leadership faced scrutiny as experts argued that the corruption crisis could jeopardize Ukraine’s military position against Russia. Both nations expedited their adoption of robotic warfare to mitigate personnel losses, and Ukraine's air defense interception rates fell to their lowest levels, making critical infrastructure increasingly vulnerable. Amid these developments, NATO warned Member States to prepare for a potential wider conflict with Russia, while the Kremlin insisted on the necessity of peace talks, albeit from a position of strength.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated several notable military and geopolitical developments. On 6 November, U.S. President Donald Trump convened a summit in Washington, D.C., with the leaders of all five Central Asian nations, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to expanding economic and military cooperation within the region. In a related move, U.S. Treasury officials targeted 32 individuals and entities involved in Iran's missile and UAV procurement networks, which included firms located in Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Türkiye, China, Hong Kong, India, Germany, and Ukraine. Simultaneously, sanctions were imposed on an Indian company for allegedly supporting Iran's ballistic missile program. Meanwhile, Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev balanced relations with Russia after the summit by reaffirming ties with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. On the technological front, China Mobile reported the completion of the Hong Kong segment of the SEA-H2X international submarine cable project, enhancing its connectivity capabilities in the region. Additionally, reports suggested China's ongoing efforts to innovate across various sectors, marking significant advancements as the nation positions itself in strategic global arenas.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel deported over 150 freed Palestinian prisoners to Egypt in a decision that raised security concerns among Israeli experts. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) arrested approximately 40 Palestinian terrorists in Bethlehem, thwarting imminent attacks in a significant operation. Meanwhile, tensions escalated along the Lebanon border, with Israel hastening the construction of a concrete wall and approving offensive military plans against Hezbollah. In an investigation, the United Nations looked into allegations of widespread torture of Palestinian detainees by Israel. Furthermore, satellite imagery confirmed that since the ceasefire on 10 October, Israel demolished more than 1,500 buildings in Gaza, prompting concerns about potential violations of truce terms. In another development, the U.S. Treasury Department revealed that two Ukrainian companies supplied military drones to Iran, as the U.S. continued to extend sanctions waivers concerning transactions with Syria by a further 180 days.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that a federal jury in Chicago, Illinois, ordered Boeing to pay over $28 million to the family of a victim from the 737 MAX crash. In Sudan, the international community recognized the country as facing the world's largest displacement crisis, demanding urgent action for peace and humanitarian access. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa criticized the United States' decision to boycott the upcoming G20 summit, emphasizing its implications for multilateral relations. The African Union rejected claims of genocide in Nigeria, urging caution in labeling the complex security situation. In South Sudan, President Salva Kiir dismissed Vice-President Bol Mel, who faced U.S. sanctions for alleged corruption and was considered a potential successor. Meanwhile, reports indicated that 42 migrants were presumed dead following a boat capsizing off Libya's coast. The UN and African Union agreed to collaborate more closely on peace and development strategies for Africa amid growing regional conflicts. Additionally, a report highlighted that over 200 Kenyans had joined Russian forces in Ukraine, a development indicating the influence of Russian recruitment strategies.</li>
