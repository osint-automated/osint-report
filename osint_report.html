Additionally, a report from the Associated Press confirmed that U.S. airstrikes targeting vessels labeled as drug runners did not involve any shipments of fentanyl to the United States, casting doubt on the Trump Administration's assertions regarding these operations. The United Nations chief condemned U.S. airstrikes in the Caribbean and Pacific, labeling them as violations of international humanitarian law. Tensions escalated in southern Lebanon as fighting resumed between Israel and Hezbollah, threatening to alter the region's power dynamics. Meanwhile, reports highlighted mass defection among Venezuelan boat crews facing accusations of narco-terrorism, revealing a complex reality that involved individuals from diverse backgrounds struggling economically. In Oklahoma, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a sting operation that led to the arrest of 34 illegal alien truck drivers, raising concerns about inadequate English proficiency and the implications for safety regulations in the transportation sector.</li>

Additionally, South Korea advanced its military capabilities following U.S. approval to develop nuclear-powered submarines, amidst its ongoing conflict with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Concurrently, Turkey issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 36 other senior officials, accusing them of genocide against Palestinians. Meanwhile, U.S. military presence in Syria increased as Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa arrived in Washington, D.C., for talks with President Donald Trump following the lifting of sanctions against him.
