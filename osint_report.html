        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the United States prepared to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations aimed at increasing pressure on President Nicolás Maduro's government. U.S. officials confirmed potential initial actions might include covert operations and that the strategy could involve efforts to overthrow Maduro. Concurrently, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned of a "potentially hazardous situation" in Venezuelan airspace, leading several international airlines to cancel flights due to increased military activity and security concerns in the region. Venezuelan officials expressed alarm over the U.S. military buildup, with Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva voicing significant concern regarding possible conflict. Public sentiment in the U.S. indicated that a majority opposed military intervention in Venezuela, urging the Trump administration for clearer explanations of its strategy.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in military and geopolitical dynamics surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On 19 November, U.S., Ukrainian, and European officials convened in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss a controversial 28-point peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which has faced skepticism from European leaders who deemed it overly favorable to Moscow. Concurrently, Ukraine officially deployed U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) against Russian military targets, marking a notable escalation in Kyiv’s operational capabilities. Russia claimed to have captured the strategic logistics hub of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, although Ukraine disputed this assertion. Tensions escalated further when U.S. lawmakers contended that the Trump-backed peace proposal represented a "Russian wish list" rather than a U.S.-authored plan, contradicting claims from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. As pressure mounted on Ukraine to accept the U.S. proposal by a 27 November deadline, the nation's leadership voiced concerns about potential compromises and ongoing Russian military activity, which included a series of strikes on Ukrainian territory coinciding with memorial observances such as Holodomor Remembrance Day on 22 November.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the Royal Australian Navy Hobart Class destroyer HMAS Brisbane conducted a routine transit through the South China Sea in accordance with international law. Additionally, a report from Taiwan's National Security Bureau suggested that the dispute between China and Japan over Taiwan remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was unlikely to resolve soon, as Beijing planned to maintain pressure on Tokyo while Japan showed little sign of backing down. Economic sanctions continued to rise in prevalence, as highlighted in a new book by former RBI governor Urjit Patel, indicating a growing influence on geopolitics. In military developments, U.S. and UK NGOs were implicated in discussions regarding potential peacebuilding efforts in Sudan. Furthermore, the U.S. energy trade with India deepened as India sought to shield itself from higher tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that tensions escalated significantly due to renewed military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted and eliminated 11 of 17 Hamas terrorists attempting to flee through tunnels in Rafah on 24 October. Concurrently, Israeli airstrikes across Gaza reportedly killed dozens, prompting Hamas to accuse Israel of violating a ceasefire, with Gaza's civil defense agency reporting 21 fatalities from strikes on 22 October. Furthermore, Israel targeted Hezbollah in Beirut, conducting its first airstrike on the city in months, which resulted in at least five deaths and several injuries. These strikes, including attacks on residential areas, received criticism from a United Nations expert who labeled them as potential war crimes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed Israel’s commitment to combating Hamas and Hezbollah, while Hamas urged international mediators to intervene amidst the ongoing violence.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Vietnam experienced severe flooding, resulting in at least 90 fatalities and 12 individuals reported missing due to torrential rains that led to significant inundation across the country. In Nigeria, armed groups continued to perpetrate mass abductions, with over 300 students and teachers kidnapped from a Catholic school in Niger state, although 50 students managed to escape captivity. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed skepticism regarding the likelihood of reaching a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within the timeframe set by former President Donald Trump, while U.S. lawmakers affirmed that a proposed Ukraine peace plan did not align with Washington's stance. The geopolitical climate in Africa also heightened tensions as Ethiopia intensified rhetoric against Eritrea over access to a port, amid fears of potential conflict. Meanwhile, South Africa's significant Test match performance against India included standout contributions from Senuran Muthusamy, who scored his maiden century, and Marco Jansen, who fell just short of his own hundred, as South Africa amassed a substantial total in Guwahati.</li>
