        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant geopolitical developments involving the United States and Venezuela. On 24 October, the US conducted a notable flight operation using B-52 bombers near the Venezuelan coast, which marked the fourth such event in recent weeks, aimed at anti-drug trafficking efforts. In response, the Venezuelan government placed its F-16 fighter jets on alert, raising regional tensions. Concurrently, the US Senate blocked a bipartisan measure that sought to limit President Donald Trump’s military authority concerning potential strikes against Venezuela. Reports also emerged from Venezuela's northeastern coast, where local residents clarified that slain boat crews, previously labeled narco-terrorists by Trump, were regular drug runners, thus complicating the narrative surrounding US military actions. In a related confrontation of organized crime, Spanish police arrested 13 suspected members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang across five cities, underscoring ongoing international efforts to combat drug trafficking networks.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia conducted large-scale attacks on residential and energy sites across Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties, including at least six deaths. Strikes affected 25 locations, including Kyiv, leading to widespread power outages and heating difficulties. Ukraine accused Russia of recruiting over 1,400 Africans into military contracts to bolster its forces, labeling the initiatives as 'suicidal.' Russian forces reportedly intensified their advance in key regions, including Pokrovsk, and eliminated Ukrainian military positions in Kupyansk. Notably, Ukraine executed a long-range drone strike on Russia's largest oil refinery in the Volgograd region, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. In geopolitical developments, NATO prepared to mobilize up to 800,000 troops in case of new hostilities, while Bulgaria sought to prevent the shutdown of its only oil refinery in light of upcoming U.S. sanctions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated heightened military and geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea, where China criticized the Philippines for alleged provocations supported by external powers. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Jiang Bin emphasized that China would not tolerate such actions, particularly as the Philippines sought joint military patrols with international partners. Additionally, China marked a significant milestone in its naval capabilities by commissioning the Fujian, its third aircraft carrier equipped with electromagnetic catapults, during a ceremony attended by President Xi Jinping in Hainan province. In a separate development, Kazakhstan announced its decision to join the Abraham Accords, aiming to strengthen its relations with the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Japan formed a partnership to exploit underwater rare earth minerals near Minamitorishima Island, in a bid to undermine China's dominance in this critical sector.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) targeted Hezbollah smuggling operations in southern Lebanon, reinforcing military pressure on the group, which has been actively replenishing its resources. Israel escalated military operations, conducting airstrikes on 2 November against Hezbollah, which it accused of flouting a year-old ceasefire. The European Union condemned these strikes, urging Israel to respect the truce. Concurrently, Gaza health officials reported over 69,000 Palestinian fatalities since hostilities resumed with Hamas. The IDF confirmed the identification of remains of Israeli hostages returned from Gaza, including 61-year-old Lior Rudaeff. In a geopolitical context, Turkey issued arrest warrants for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on charges of genocide, in response to the war in Gaza.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Dr. Jamal Eltaeb of Sudan received the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity for his efforts in addressing the country's humanitarian crisis amidst ongoing civil conflict. The United Nations warned of "intensified hostilities" in Sudan, despite the Rapid Support Forces agreeing to a U.S.-backed ceasefire aimed at alleviating the severe humanitarian situation. This truce followed two and a half years of warfare, which has been characterized by significant displacement and humanitarian needs. In geopolitical developments, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a boycott of the G20 summit in South Africa, citing discredited allegations of persecution against white farmers as the reason for not sending U.S. officials to the event. Additionally, the Trump administration revoked deportation protections for South Sudanese immigrants, reflecting shifts in U.S. immigration policy that critics associated with Christian nationalism. Meanwhile, rising attacks from Sahel-based terror groups prompted West African nations to enhance border security and seek better coordination with landlocked Sahel states. Lastly, Ukraine accused Russia of recruiting over 1,400 African nationals into military contracts to support its war efforts.</li>
