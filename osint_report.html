        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the Venezuelan government rejected the U.S. designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization, calling the move a "ridiculous lie." Concurrently, the Trump administration ramped up diplomatic and military pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, intensifying military operations in the Caribbean and accusing Maduro's regime of state-sponsored drug trafficking. In response to these escalating tensions, airlines suspended flights to Venezuela following warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about a deteriorating security situation due to heightened military activity. The U.S. military also reinforced its presence off the coast of Venezuela, indicating preparations for a potential new phase of operations against the Maduro regime.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. and Ukrainian officials made progress in Geneva, Switzerland, regarding a peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, yet provided few specifics after discussions on the proposal. On 24 October, a significant Russian drone attack killed at least four individuals and injured 17 in Kharkiv, Ukraine. In response to pressures from various quarters, President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted the gratitude of Ukraine for U.S. support amid criticism from former President Donald Trump regarding perceived ingratitude. Meanwhile, European leaders expressed skepticism about Trump's peace plan, while NATO signed a multi-million dollar cloud security deal with Google. Ukrainian soldiers at the front reacted defiantly to the U.S. peace proposal, and an investigation into corruption near Zelensky's administration complicated negotiations. Additionally, Ukraine’s largest mobile operator, Kyivstar, launched Starlink's direct-to-cell satellite service, marking a technological advancement as military tensions remained high.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Palau's strategic location and its diplomatic ties with Taiwan positioned it as a focal point in the escalating US-China rivalry. Reports highlighted China's economic pressure on Japan in response to its involvement in Taiwan-related issues, suggesting potential reciprocal damage to China’s economy. In Australia, analysts noted that the Trump administration's approach could alter its traditional alliances, forcing Australia to prioritize national self-interest. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) demonstrated increased agency in geopolitical matters while avoiding direct references to China. Discussions continued in Japan regarding the need for a nuclear capability amid rapid geopolitical changes. Furthermore, the international landscape revealed renewed foreign interest in the Gulf of Aden coastline, echoing past Soviet strategic encounters. Additional developments included the emergence of space as a critical domain of warfare, with calls for the US to establish norms of space warfare alongside traditional military domains. In climate-related news, experts warned of an imminent decline in the Indonesian Throughflow due to rising CO2 levels, which could signify critical repercussions for global climate patterns.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel continued to violate ceasefire agreements in Gaza, reportedly committing nearly 500 violations and resulting in 342 Palestinian fatalities, according to the Gaza Government Media Office. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to persist with strikes against both Gaza and Lebanon, defying international calls for restraint and further escalating tensions. On 23 November, Israeli airstrikes in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah's Chief of General Staff, Haytham Ali Tabatabai, and four other fighters, marking the first such attack in the capital since a ceasefire was established a year prior. Hezbollah condemned the assault as a "treacherous attack," while Iran demanded accountability for Israeli actions in Lebanon. Meanwhile, skepticism surrounded President Trump's peace plan for Ukraine among European leaders, and Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a significant escalation in military and geopolitical tensions. In Nigeria, Pope Leo XIV issued appeals for the release of approximately 300 students and staff abducted from St. Mary’s Catholic School, which prompted a police-military joint operation to rescue the captives. In Sudan, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan rejected a U.S.-backed peace proposal, indicating ongoing conflict despite international diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, at the G20 summit in South Africa, leaders struggled to address geopolitical divisions, with particular tensions highlighted between Japan and China, where no discussions occurred amid unresolved disputes. The international community remained focused on broader issues of trade and cooperation, particularly between EU and African leaders, emphasizing critical materials and migration challenges in the wake of global instability.</li>
