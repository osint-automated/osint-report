        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. The U.S. escalated military pressure on Venezuela by deploying B-52 bombers within 50 miles of Venezuela’s coast, marking four such flights since mid-October, alongside naval assets including the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier. Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil responded by warning against any aggressive actions from the U.S., urging regional states to maintain peace. Concurrently, the U.S. conducted strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific, resulting in at least six fatalities, which brought the total death toll from these operations to at least 75. In a separate context, the Pentagon announced the deployment of ground forces for training exercises in Panama's jungle, marking the first such activity in decades.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine requested 25 Patriot air defense systems from the United States to counter ongoing Russian attacks on the country's power grid. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces continued to engage in intense battles for control of Pokrovsk, a key stronghold in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming that Russia had amassed 170,000 troops in the area. Russian forces confirmed the liberation of the Novoye settlement in the Zaporozhye region, marking another territorial gain amid ongoing conflicts. Meanwhile, millions of Ukrainians faced power cuts due to Russia's air strikes on energy infrastructure, prompting European allies to consider reallocating their Patriot missile systems to Ukraine sooner than anticipated. In response to increasing drone incursions prompting airport closures in Belgium, the United Kingdom announced the deployment of anti-drone teams alongside France and Germany to assist in managing the situation.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Typhoon Fung-wong significantly impacted the northwestern Philippines, resulting in at least eight fatalities and displacing over 1.4 million people. The typhoon made landfall on 8 November and brought heavy rains and strong winds, triggering floods and landslides that knocked out power across entire provinces. As it moved into the South China Sea, authorities continued to assess the extensive damage, particularly in Aurora province. Additionally, geopolitical tensions rose as China conducted military exercises in disputed waters of the South China Sea and stationed its newest aircraft carrier, CNS Fujian, at a base in the region, raising concerns among neighboring countries.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel resumed air operations targeting positions in Gaza City and southern Lebanon, specifically hitting sites associated with Hezbollah and military infrastructure aimed at rebuilding capabilities. Iran continued to bolster its military preparedness amidst indications from Israeli officials that conflict may resume, while US sanctions officials reported Iran provided approximately $1 billion to Hezbollah in 2023 despite ongoing international sanctions. Additionally, Turkey sought to negotiate the safe passage of an estimated 200 civilians trapped in tunnels under Gaza, complicating dynamics as the US pressured Israel regarding its military actions and humanitarian concerns. In a significant diplomatic move, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa made a historic visit to the White House, marking the first such visit by a Syrian leader since the country's post-independence history. Tensions escalated further as the Houthis in Yemen threatened to resume hostilities against Israel if fighting recommenced in Gaza.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments across various regions. The UN warned that climate change has displaced millions, with weather-related disasters forcing a quarter of a billion people to flee in the last decade. In Nigeria, protesters disrupted the soft opening of a new museum intended to house returned artifacts, highlighting ongoing social tensions. In Mali, an armed group instilled palpable fear among the populace. The United Arab Emirates demonstrated reluctance to participate in an international force in Gaza, which the U.S. sought given the UAE's cooperative stance with Israel. Increased use of armed drones marked a trend in African conflicts, although they failed to deliver decisive victories. A humanitarian crisis unfolded in Sudan, where 30 million people required aid amid ongoing conflict, and the RSF paramilitary group faced accusations of genocide in Al-Fashir. Meanwhile, a Paris court ordered the release of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy from prison pending appeal. Finally, suspected pirates boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean, marking a serious escalation in maritime security threats in the region.</li>
