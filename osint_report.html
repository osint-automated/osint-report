        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant violence erupted across Mexico following the death of Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, known as "El Mencho," leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The Mexican military, with assistance from U.S. intelligence, killed El Mencho in a raid in the western state of Jalisco on 22 February. In response, cartel members initiated a series of retaliatory attacks that swept through more than a dozen states, resulting in the burning of vehicles, blocked highways, and violence in major cities such as Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Reports indicated at least 26 fatalities, including members of the security forces, as chaos ensued, prompting both the U.S. and Canadian embassies to issue "shelter in place" orders for tourists. Authorities postponed several soccer matches, and American citizens found themselves stranded as airlines canceled flights amid the unrest. President Claudia Sheinbaum encouraged citizens to remain calm while the situation unfolded, which many feared would escalate further in the days to come.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia continued to feel the economic and social consequences of its war against Ukraine, now in its fourth year. On 23 October, Russia launched large-scale missile and drone attacks across various Ukrainian regions, resulting in casualties, including the deaths of three civilians. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, remained resolute, asserting Ukraine's commitment to continue fighting "for another three years" despite facing increasing internal pressures. Meanwhile, Russian military intelligence accused Britain of orchestrating an assassination attempt on a Russian general linked to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, showcasing the escalating rhetoric between the two nations. Additionally, Hungary blocked the 20th package of EU sanctions against Russia, pivoting on the re-opening of the Druzhba oil pipeline as a condition, which caused friction within the EU. In geopolitical analyses, some Finnish politicians proposed a reversion of NATO to its 1997 borders as a means to establish lasting peace in Ukraine. Meanwhile, over 1,000 individuals from various African nations, including Kenya, were reportedly fighting for Russia, many allegedly recruited under false pretenses.</li>

Additionally, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany embarked on a significant inaugural visit to China, reflecting Germany's aim to establish new global partnerships following the perceived retreat of U.S. influence.</li>
