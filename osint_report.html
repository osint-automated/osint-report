        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. military operations against alleged drug trafficking in the Caribbean escalated significantly. On 7 November 2025, U.S. forces conducted their 17th strike on a suspected drug boat, resulting in three additional fatalities and raising the total death toll to approximately 70 since the campaign began in early September. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated that these strikes would continue until "narco-terrorists" ceased their activities. Simultaneously, the U.S. Senate Republicans voted to reject bipartisan legislation aimed at limiting President Donald Trump’s military authority over Venezuela, facilitating ongoing military actions without requiring congressional approval. This legislative decision came amidst increasing pressures on the administration to reevaluate its approach to Venezuela and rising international concerns regarding the consequences of U.S. military actions in the region.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that NATO's Secretary General claimed the alliance began to rectify its ammunition production shortfall against Russia, marking an increase in output not seen in decades. The German military official noted Russia retained the capacity to launch a limited attack on NATO territory, contingent on Western allies' postures. Simultaneously, Russian oil and gas revenues plummeted to 7.5 trillion rubles in early November, a decline from 9.5 trillion rubles the previous year, impacting Moscow's economic viability amid intensifying US sanctions. Fungible tensions manifested as Ukrainian forces conducted retaliatory airstrikes on Russian infrastructure, while Russian air assaults targeted civilian facilities in Ukraine. On the diplomatic front, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán prepared for discussions with US President Donald Trump regarding sanctions exemptions for Russian energy. The EU imposed restrictions on multi-entry visas for Russian nationals, reflecting escalating geopolitical tensions. Additionally, Sweden and Ukraine agreed to collaborate on developing new weapons technologies, reinforcing military ties.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that China commissioned its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, on 5 November 2025, enhancing its naval capabilities and asserting its influence further from its coast. The Fujian's commissioning marked a significant milestone in President Xi Jinping's military modernization efforts, enabling the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to close the gap with the United States Navy. Meanwhile, North Korea launched a ballistic missile on 7 November 2025, which flew approximately 700 kilometers before landing in the East Sea, indicating a continued pattern of weapon development following U.S. sanctions. In the South China Sea, China's Defense Ministry condemned the Philippines and external powers for perceived provocations. Concurrently, Japan called for a Code of Conduct that respected the rights of non-parties involved in maritime disputes. Natural disasters also drew attention, as Typhoon Kalmaegi caused severe damage in the Philippines and Vietnam, claiming at least five lives in Vietnam and over 188 in the Philippines.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that NPR's Israel correspondent, Daniel Estrin, entered the Gaza Strip for the first time since the conflict began, although he required a military escort. On 6 November, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Kazakhstan would join the Abraham Accords with Israel, deemed a symbolic move to bolster this diplomatic initiative. The IDF continued to conduct operations in Gaza, vowing to eliminate all Hamas tunnels, while Trump stated that an international stabilization force would be deployed to Gaza "very soon." Additionally, Israel intensified airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, which prompted local condemnation from Lebanese officials and residents who vowed to remain despite the aggression. Meanwhile, reports emerged of Israeli bureaucratic measures obstructing aid delivery to Gaza and allegations that Israeli forces left behind booby-trapped items, sparking widespread concern among humanitarian workers.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the International Criminal Court confirmed 39 war crimes charges against Joseph Kony, the notorious leader of Uganda’s rebel group, setting the stage for a future trial should he be captured. Tensions escalated in the Horn of Africa as Ethiopia’s ambitions for a seaside port raised fears of a potential invasion of Eritrea. The situation in Sudan remained critical, with reports of increased violence as the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group was implicated in massacres against civilians, utilizing Canadian-made firearms. Simultaneously, the UAE faced scrutiny for its connection to the RSF, with revelations linking a senior official to a company recruiting foreign mercenaries to support the group. In maritime developments, EU naval forces mobilized to respond to a pirate seizure of a Malta-flagged tanker off the Somali coast, signaling heightened maritime security challenges in the region.</li>
