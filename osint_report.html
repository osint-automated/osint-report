        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump, while aboard Air Force One on 31 October 2025, stated that he was not considering military strikes against Venezuela, amidst concerns in Caracas over a U.S. military buildup in the region. On 2 November, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the United States conducted a strike against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, resulting in the deaths of three individuals. In a parallel geopolitical context, China's government defended its cooperation with Venezuela, rejecting U.S. threats of force in international dealings. Additionally, the U.S. military began upgrading a long-abandoned Cold War naval base in the Caribbean, indicating preparations for potential military interventions in Venezuela.

Concurrently, Ukrainian forces reported intensified drone-on-drone engagements and preparations to mass-produce interceptor drones to counter Russian Shahed drones. Russian military actions also escalated, with forces reportedly tightening their encirclement of Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk, and launching air strikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, leading to multiple casualties on 3 November. In a separate geopolitical development, the Chinese and Russian leaders pledged to strengthen bilateral ties amidst external pressures, while North Korea sent approximately 5,000 construction troops to Russia, indicating potential military collaboration.</li>

In response to Bangladesh's recent accession to the U.N. Water Convention, concerns emerged regarding potential conflicts with India over shared water resources. The Philippines experienced severe devastation from Typhoon Kalmaegi, resulting in at least 46 fatalities and leaving victims trapped on roofs in flooded areas.

The Israeli military's former top lawyer, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, resigned amid a scandal over alleged abuses in a military prison and was subsequently arrested. Concurrently, Iran reportedly armed Iraqi militias in anticipation of potential conflicts with Israel, while the Iranian Foreign Minister declared the continuation of the country's uranium enrichment program.
