        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Venezuela's aviation authority banned six major international airlines, citing accusations of "terrorism" after they ceased operations due to a warning from the United States regarding increased military activity. Tensions escalated as Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro proclaimed that the U.S. "cannot defeat" his country, while simultaneously expressing awareness of the U.S. Navy's movements in the Southern Caribbean. The United States continued to vocalize its stance against "narco-terrorists," with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth asserting a commitment to eliminate drug traffickers targeting the U.S. In parallel, President Donald Trump’s inconsistent advocacy for peace in Ukraine persisted, amidst broader U.S. military pressures on Venezuela implying a potential shift in regional power dynamics.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demands for ceding key Ukrainian territories ahead of the arrival of a US delegation in Moscow for talks scheduled next week. Ukraine's envoy to the United States, Olga Stefanishyna, emphasized the need for a peace plan that ensures no future Russian aggression. Russian courts convicted eight individuals on terrorism charges related to an attack on a bridge connecting Russia to annexed Crimea, sentencing them to life in prison. Putin declared Russia's determination to fight until “the last Ukrainian dies.” Reports documented that Russia launched 142 drones overnight on 27 November, while Ukrainian pilots claimed a 98% kill rate against Russian drones using Mirage 2000 fighters. Finland's Foreign Minister commented on the potential for US-backed peace talks, and NATO's Deputy Secretary General visited Kyiv to strengthen ties with the Ukrainian government. In parallel, President Emmanuel Macron of France announced a reinstatement of limited military service with 3,000 volunteers planned for next year, highlighting a broader European focus on military preparedness amidst ongoing tensions in Ukraine.</li>

        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Israel continued military operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, marking a year since the ceasefire agreement. Israeli airstrikes hit the villages of Jarmak and Mahmoudiya on 24 October, part of nearly 10,000 recorded violations since the ceasefire. Concurrently, Hamas reportedly established a base in Syria and assisted Hezbollah in rebuilding its rocket supplies. In Gaza, Israeli forces targeted buildings in Bureij and eastern Khan Younis, escalating their aerial assaults despite a purported ceasefire agreement. As of late October, Israel returned 15 Palestinian bodies to Gaza, but two hostages from the 7 October attack remained unreturned. Tensions in the region persisted, with fears rising of another war as Israeli operations intensified across both Gaza and Lebanon.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments across various regions. On 1 November, the Nigerian President Bola Tinubu declared a nationwide emergency in response to recent mass abductions of schoolchildren and an increase in violent attacks. Concurrently, the Guinean military swore in General Horta Nta Na Man as the interim leader following a coup that ousted President Embalo, effectively halting the electoral process and closing borders. In the Red Sea region, analysts assessed a shift in global influence, involving key states such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In diplomatic relations, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that South Africa would not be invited to the upcoming G20 summit in Miami due to claims of a diplomatic snub and alleged human rights abuses, which South Africa vehemently denied as distortions harming international cooperation. Meanwhile, in Somalia, humanitarian groups reported a drought emergency as failed rainy seasons left millions at risk of hunger.</li>
