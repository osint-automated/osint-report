        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump maintained a firm stance on not ruling out military action against Venezuela amidst escalating tensions. The United States deployed the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean and sent approximately 15,000 troops to the region. This military buildup raised concerns of a potential regime change in Venezuela, with former U.S. officials asserting that the operations appeared less focused on counter-narcotics and more aligned with regime change objectives. Concurrently, Trump expressed openness to discussing diplomatic solutions with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who also signaled a willingness to engage in talks. The U.S. further heightened pressure on Venezuela by designating the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization, while opposition leader María Corina Machado spoke of a vision for a post-Maduro era amidst the mounting U.S. military presence.</li>

On 12 November, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that two Ukrainian nationals, allegedly collaborating with Russian intelligence, were suspected of causing a railway explosion in Poland, which damaged a crucial line used for transporting goods to Ukraine. This incident raised alarms about Russian sabotage efforts in the region. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy planned to meet with U.S. envoy Donald Trump’s representative to intensify peace talks as Russia gained ground in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, specifically around Huliaipole. Additionally, the EU’s defense commissioner emphasized that Europe was unprepared to effectively respond to potential Russian drone attacks, underscoring a pressing need for stronger defense integration with Ukraine’s military capabilities.</li>

Japan remained on alert, advising its citizens in China to adopt enhanced safety measures amid escalating tensions related to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks about Taiwan, leading to heightened military and coastguard activities from Beijing in the region. The top U.S. admiral acknowledged China's significant naval expansion and emphasized the importance of collaboration with South Korea and Japan for countering Chinese influence, further underscoring regional security concerns. In response to ongoing geopolitical shifts, U.S. sanctions against Russian oil firms impacted Russian oil revenues, indicating broader economic tensions.

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza as winter rains raised fears of disease and death among displaced Palestinians, prompting aid agencies to call for additional shelter. The UN Security Council endorsed a peace plan proposed by former President Donald Trump, linking reconstruction efforts in Gaza to the demilitarization of Hamas, which the group rejected, stating that the resolution failed to meet their demands. Meanwhile, a water provider in Gaza suspended services after Hamas detained a company employee, affecting water access for over 1 million people. In military developments, Israel's military reported the killing of a Hezbollah operative in southern Lebanon. Jordan's parliament reinstated mandatory conscription for men starting in early 2026. Additionally, US President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House, discussing trade, security, and potential arms sales, including F-35 jets, all while reinforcing Israel's stance against Palestinian statehood. Reports surfaced of Israeli actions against Palestinians in the West Bank, where violence continued to escalate, and claims emerged that a Polish company supplied explosives for Israel's operations in Gaza.

Additionally, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned that approximately 318 million people could face acute food insecurity by 2026, reflecting a deepening global hunger crisis. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court prepared to sentence Sudanese Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for his role in Darfur atrocities, where he maintained his innocence, claiming mistaken identity.
