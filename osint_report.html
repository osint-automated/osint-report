In Venezuela, the legislature passed an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds of political detainees, a decision that signified governmental acknowledgment of the extensive political imprisonment.

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments related to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In the remote village of Sedanka, Russia, almost all fighting-age men left to join the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military benefited from new ground robots developed by Ratel Robotics that launched fiber-optic drones closer to frontlines, enhancing troop safety. As of day 1,457 of the conflict, Russian forces executed multiple strikes on Ukrainian military facilities using precision weapons, while Ukraine faced severe challenges, including frostbite and food shortages among its soldiers in the Zaporozhye Region. Ukraine announced its boycott of the upcoming Winter Paralympics opening ceremony due to the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes, invoking international condemnation. Concurrently, reports emerged of a staggering $90 billion oil smuggling ring supporting the Kremlin, as well as new U.S. interventions aiding Ukraine in addressing corruption within its energy sector. Poland formally withdrew from the Ottawa Convention on landmines, citing Russian threats, while Hungary blocked a €90 billion EU loan to Ukraine. Moreover, the status of negotiations for a peace treaty between Russia and Japan remained precarious, with the Kremlin citing Tokyo's unfriendly stance as a barrier to discussions.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that approximately ten US fighter jets approached China's air defense identification zone near South Korea, reflecting ongoing tensions in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, in her first speech after winning election, accused Communist China of coercion and promised significant defense reforms alongside fostering closer ties with the United States. NATO deployed the TCG Anadolu drone carrier to its eastern flank in response to repeated incursions by Russian aircraft. Oil prices hit a six-month high, surpassing $71 per barrel due to escalating risks of US military actions against Iran, which could disrupt global oil supplies. Additionally, India prepared to enhance its underwater nuclear capabilities with the imminent commissioning of the INS Aridhaman nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, while Pakistan eyed eight Chinese submarines as part of its military expansion.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Hamas elected a new interim leader following the deaths of its top figures in Israeli strikes. In the West Bank, Israeli settlers shot and killed a 19-year-old Palestinian American man during a village attack, drawing international condemnation. Indonesia, Morocco, and Kosovo, among others, committed to sending troops in support of international efforts in Gaza, while Egypt and Jordan agreed to train local police forces. In Gaza, Doctors Without Borders withdrew personnel from Nasser Medical Complex after an armed confrontation in the hospital's vicinity. A new study revealed that over 75,000 Palestinians died during the first 15 months of Israel's military offensive, a figure significantly higher than previously reported. Additionally, an Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon resulted in one fatality, as tensions continued to escalate with threats from Israel to target Iranian-backed groups. Rising oil prices reflected concerns over potential US military actions against Iran, with the Brent crude oil benchmark exceeding $71 per barrel. President Donald Trump warned Iran to reach a nuclear deal soon or face severe consequences, as his foreign policy remained under scrutiny amidst growing domestic opposition to military intervention.</li>

In Sudan, the government sought foreign investment to explore its untapped mineral wealth, worth billions. In Nigeria, a series of raids in Kebbi state led to the deaths of at least 34 individuals, while Meta collaborated with the UK National Crime Agency and Nigerian Police to disrupt an alleged online scam operation. Lastly, following the death of Wagner's founder, Russia’s SVR intelligence agency took over the mercenary group's influence operations in Africa.</li>
