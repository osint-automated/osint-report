        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments concerning the United States and Venezuela. President Donald Trump confirmed the potential for U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, stating that Nicolás Maduro's days were numbered during a Politico interview on 8 December. The Venezuelan armed forces responded by recruiting 5,600 new troops amid escalating threats from Washington. Additionally, U.S. military operations included at least 23 strikes against boats off Venezuela's coast, which the Trump administration linked to drug trafficking. In related remarks, political commentator Jon Stewart drew parallels between the U.S. posture toward Venezuela and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, underscoring the historical implications of U.S. foreign policy. As Washington intensifies its military pressure, Canada has expressed intent to monitor the situation closely, grappling with its role in cooperative operations in the Caribbean amidst emerging legal and ethical concerns regarding these strikes.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that tensions continued to escalate in Eastern Europe as Russian forces intensified efforts to capture the remaining strongholds in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amid a tour of European nations to garner support, reiterated that Ukraine would not cede any territory to Russia, rejecting proposals he deemed overly favorable to the Kremlin from U.S. President Donald Trump. In Lithuania, authorities declared a state of emergency in response to concerns over hybrid warfare tactics from Belarus, which is allied with Russia. Simultaneously, Finland's rising status in European security became evident as it and Sweden joined NATO following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reports also highlighted significant desertions from the Ukrainian military amidst escalating casualties. In other international developments, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed the need for China to leverage its influence in Russia, while Indian oil imports from Russia significantly increased despite ongoing sanctions.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open-source reporting indicated that New Zealand's largest naval vessel was shadowed by seven Chinese warships during its deployment to East Asia last month, marking a significant demonstration of military presence in the region. Additionally, on 26 October, the U.S. Navy successfully recovered an F/A-18F Super Hornet and an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter that crashed into the South China Sea. In Iraq, the Oil Ministry extended exclusive invitations to major U.S. energy firms to develop the West Qurna 2 oilfield, following the withdrawal of Russian firm Lukoil amid increased sanctions. Lastly, South Korea scrambled military jets in response to unauthorized incursions by seven Russian and two Chinese aircraft into its air defense identification zone, emphasizing existing regional tensions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant developments in the military and geopolitical landscape. Hamas announced on 24 October that it would not progress to the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire unless further pressure was placed on Israel. Concurrently, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted airstrikes targeting Hezbollah training sites in southern Lebanon, claiming to disrupt their military infrastructure. This action contributed to an already strained US-brokered ceasefire. In response to ongoing tensions, Hamas asserted that disarmament would not occur while Israeli forces remained in Gaza, complicating the situation further. Additionally, IDF activities included the seizure of a terror network and the confiscation of weaponry in Tulkarm, West Bank. The Israeli military's strikes in Syria escalated as well, with reports indicating over 600 attacks conducted throughout the past year. The geopolitical climate remained tense, with various nations assessing their positions regarding the conflicts in the Middle East.</li>

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan seized control of the Heglig oilfield, marking a critical shift in national resources. Simultaneously, the RSF’s efforts to take over an oil refinery in South Sudan were described as a geopolitical maneuver to exert pressure on the government. An escalating wave of coups in West Africa prompted the Economic Community of West African States to declare a state of emergency, while Benin's government thwarted a coup attempt with support from Nigerian forces, drawing attention to the stability of its democracy ahead of elections scheduled for April 2026. In Burkina Faso, heightened military alertness ensued following an incident involving a Nigerian Air Force aircraft that made an emergency landing due to technical issues, which was perceived as a potential violation of airspace. The International Criminal Court sentenced Muhammad Ali Abd Al-Rahman, a Sudanese militia leader, to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed in Darfur, underscoring ongoing security challenges in the region.</li>
