        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Moscow threatened to launch nuclear warheads against NATO states providing assistance to Ukraine, escalating tensions in global military dynamics. The U.S. military built up forces in the Caribbean amid increasing pressure on Venezuela, leading to strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats. However, legal concerns arose within the U.S. Southern Command, where the senior military lawyer challenged the legality of these operations but was overruled by higher authorities. This military engagement followed an ongoing trend of U.S. involvement in various conflicts, transitioning from Afghanistan to escalating situations in Ukraine, Gaza, and Iran. Moreover, Venezuelan migrants faced difficulties while seeking refuge in Mexico, supported by the UNHCR and the Irish embassy in Mexico City.</li>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Russia significantly escalated its recruitment efforts for Ukrainian saboteurs via Telegram, targeting children and teenagers to conduct sabotage and bombings within Ukraine, as reported by the Ukrainian government. Additionally, a deadly Russian attack on two nine-story apartment buildings in Ternopil, Ukraine, resulted in at least 25 deaths, further intensifying the humanitarian crisis. The geopolitical landscape grew more complex as President Donald Trump reportedly approved a controversial 28-point peace plan demanding significant territorial concessions from Ukraine, which caught U.S. congressional supporters of Ukraine off guard. Meanwhile, tensions between Russia and NATO heightened, with the UK accusing a Russian spy ship of endangering pilots by pointing lasers at them, prompting discussions of military responses, while the EU unveiled plans for a military mobility area to enhance troop movements near Russia's border.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Malaysia intensified maritime patrols and enforcement operations in the South China Sea, affirming its stance on sovereignty amidst ongoing island-building activities by Vietnam and China. In the United Kingdom, Defence Secretary John Healey condemned actions by the Russian spy ship Yantar for allegedly pointing lasers at pilots observing the vessel, stating that Britain was prepared to respond. Meanwhile, the Philippines sentenced a local mayor, identified as a 'Chinese spy,' to life imprisonment after authorities discovered one of the country's largest scam operations in her town of Bamban.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the U.K. Covid inquiry prepared to publish its second set of findings detailing the political decisions made throughout 2020 regarding the Covid response. The World Health Organization (WHO) targeted to vaccinate over 40,000 children against various diseases in Gaza, capitalizing on a recent ceasefire amidst ongoing violence. In Israel, air strikes killed four individuals in Gaza, as Hamas reported that over 300 people died in the region since the ceasefire was established. The Knesset advanced a bill to block the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's access to utilities and reclaim Israeli land. Meanwhile, Ireland moved forward with a bill banning goods and services from Judea, Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem, which drew warnings from U.S. and Jewish leaders about potential diplomatic consequences. Additionally, U.S. and Saudi officials signed a joint declaration for civilian nuclear cooperation, moving forward with Saudi Arabia's nuclear ambitions.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Operation Dudula, an anti-migrant group in South Africa, blocked foreigners from accessing public health clinics. In Johannesburg, activists projected demands onto buildings in anticipation of the upcoming G20 summit, where leaders from the world's wealthiest nations gathered. The summit took place without U.S. President Donald Trump, who boycotted the event, overshadowing discussions. In Nigeria, security forces searched for approximately two dozen schoolgirls abducted in a church attack that resulted in two fatalities. Meanwhile, Germany pledged €1 billion to Brazil's rainforest protection fund, underlining international efforts towards environmental conservation. In Ethiopia, Malaysia's Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim initiated a new phase of cooperation between the two countries with the signing of four memoranda of understanding, highlighting a commitment to health and tourism development.</li>
