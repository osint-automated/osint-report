This warning highlighted potential risks associated with flying in the airspace surrounding the country. Meanwhile, Colombian authorities reported a significant drug bust, seizing cocaine worth over $388 million, which they claimed prevented the circulation of 35 million doses.

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the G20 summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa, featured discussions among Ukraine's allies regarding a U.S.-drafted peace plan for Ukraine, which President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to accept by Thanksgiving. The 28-point plan proposed ceding approximately 20% of Ukraine's territory to Russia, a condition that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned could undermine Ukraine's dignity and security. Concurrently, U.S. officials indicated that failure to accept the plan could result in reduced intelligence sharing and weapons support for Ukraine. In military developments, Russia claimed to have captured several villages in eastern Ukraine, a statement that Kyiv did not confirm. Overall, Ukraine found itself navigating complex geopolitical dynamics, balancing U.S. demands with its own military and internal political challenges amid ongoing concerns over corruption within its government.</li>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Chinese diplomats, known as "wolf warriors," intensified their campaign against Japan, criticizing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in nations affected by Japan's World War II military actions.

Meanwhile, the European Union had pledged to donate over five million potassium iodide pills to Ukraine in August 2022 to prepare for potential nuclear incidents related to the ongoing conflict surrounding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated significant military and geopolitical developments. The US government faced backlash for its decision to deport Christian converts back to Iran amid ongoing persecution in their home country. Iran's President announced plans to relocate the capital from Tehran due to an acute ecological crisis and water shortages affecting the city. Scheduled military actions were debated in Pakistan as it considered joining a Gaza stabilization force, balancing its alliances with public sentiment and economic needs. In the Middle East, the UN reported that at least 67 children died in Gaza since the ceasefire began, raising concerns over violations of the peace agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.

In Africa, the first G20 summit, hosted in South Africa, commenced amid a US boycott led by Trump, focusing on long-standing issues affecting developing nations.
