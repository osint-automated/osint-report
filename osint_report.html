    <p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, President Trump designated fentanyl as a "weapon of mass destruction," enabling expanded U.S. military operations against drug trafficking linked to Venezuela and increasing the military presence in Trinidad and Tobago. In the Ukraine conflict, President Zelenskyy and 34 nations established an International Claims Commission for reparations, while Russia launched significant UAV attacks despite ongoing diplomatic efforts for a peace agreement. U.S. intelligence reported increased collaboration among Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, with China's maritime forces clashing with Philippine vessels in the South China Sea. In Israel and Gaza, domestic dysfunction heightened alongside the humanitarian crisis exacerbated by severe weather, while conflict escalated in the West Bank. In Africa, notable developments included the Taliban's internet shutdown in Afghanistan and violence in Nigeria, while M23 militia's compliance with a U.S.-brokered peace accord marked a significant development in the DRC.</p>

        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that President Donald Trump designated fentanyl as a "weapon of mass destruction" on 15 December, which expanded the U.S. government's authority in its military and drug war efforts. This designation followed military strikes that killed eight men aboard three vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which U.S. authorities claimed were linked to narco-trafficking. Concurrently, U.S. military presence increased in Trinidad and Tobago, with plans to potentially target drug cartels, which Trump previously labeled as terrorist organizations. Reports surfaced of at least 20 oil tankers linked to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela operating in the Caribbean, generating substantial revenue amidst U.S. sanctions. The U.S. prepared to seize more tankers filled with Venezuelan oil and wargamed the fall of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, anticipating violent power struggles. The Trump administration faced scrutiny and skepticism regarding its actions and intentions, especially concerning its naval operations near Venezuela, where military strikes allegedly aimed at undermining Maduro's regime were framed under an anti-drug narrative.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>EUCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy along with 34 other countries approved plans on 24 October to establish a compensation body aimed at addressing damages incurred due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The creation of the International Claims Commission tasked with evaluating reparation claims coincided with heightened tensions surrounding the ongoing conflict, with the Ukrainian Air Force reporting that Russia launched 69 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overnight on 16 December. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism regarding a potential peace deal, noting that Washington had offered a NATO-like security guarantee to Ukraine amidst stalled negotiations and ongoing diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov acknowledged Russia's interest in concluding the conflict, although experts largely deemed a ceasefire deal improbable given significant unresolved issues.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>PACOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Heng Guan faced deportation from the United States after risking his safety to document evidence of the Uyghur genocide in China. Intelligence reports outlined increased coordination among Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea in military, cyber, and diplomatic domains, reflecting challenges to U.S. deterrence strategies. Notably, Chinese maritime forces used water cannons against Filipino fishing boats near Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea, prompting condemnation from both the United States and Canada. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro characterized these actions as "dangerous" and "inhumane," while additional reports revealed that Philippine personnel allegedly threatened Chinese law enforcement officers with knives during a separate incident at Xianbin Jiao. Furthermore, Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expressed concerns over a recent joint bomber flight by China and Russia near Shikoku, Japan, labeling it saber-rattling.  The European Union also initiated talks regarding China's support for Russia, including potential weapons transfers.</li>

        <li><b>CENTCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that the geopolitical influence of Israel diminished as domestic dysfunction increased. In Gaza, members of the Civil Defense recovered the remains of 45 individuals from a building destroyed in an Israeli airstrike two years prior. Simultaneously, severe winter storms compounded the suffering of displaced Palestinians in Gaza, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis amid ongoing aid restrictions. In U.S. politics, a poll showed a widening divide among younger Republicans concerning support for Israel, potentially benefiting Democrats. Conflict in the region remained acute, as Israeli forces conducted multiple raids in the occupied West Bank, and tensions escalated after the U.S. government began investigating the Israeli killing of senior Hamas commander Raad Saad for potentially violating a ceasefire. Hezbollah reportedly committed nearly 2,000 violations of the ceasefire with Israel over the past year. In Iran, a tragic bus crash claimed 13 lives on a central highway, while the government unexpectedly increased gasoline prices after a lengthy freeze.</li>

        <li><b>AFRICOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated that Afghanistan experienced a deliberate internet shutdown mandated by the Taliban government for two days in September, following a similar localized outage. South Sudan's government grounded four United Nations aircraft, alleging their involvement in activities jeopardizing national security. The M23 militia announced plans to withdraw from Uvira, a strategic city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, at the request of the United States, which encouraged compliance with a previously established peace accord. In Nigeria, a suicide bomber targeted a military position in Borno state, resulting in the deaths of at least five soldiers. The International Rescue Committee placed Sudan at the top of its Emergency Watchlist for the third consecutive year, citing ongoing humanitarian crises exacerbated by violent conflict.</li>
