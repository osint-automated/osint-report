        <li><b>SOUTHCOM:</b> During the reporting period, open source reporting indicated heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, exemplified by President Donald Trump's declaration of a "total and complete blockade" against the country on 16 December. This move aimed to target sanctioned oil tankers, reflecting ongoing U.S. claims over Venezuelan oil interests which date back to the nationalization of the industry in the 1970s. Notably, U.S. military actions in the Pacific claimed four lives in a strike on an alleged drug boat, adding to an escalating death toll that approached 100 from recent U.S. strikes. The U.S. House of Representatives also rejected attempts to limit military action against Venezuela, while Russia warned of the dangers of U.S. military engagement in the region. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned U.S. actions as attempts to overthrow his government and warned against the consequences of military aggression. Additionally, reports highlighted the exacerbating humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, with increased uncertainty among the population due to these escalating geopolitical tensions.</li>
